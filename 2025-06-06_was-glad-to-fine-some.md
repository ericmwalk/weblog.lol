Was glad to fine some time to get out for a [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14719784812) today and actually I was able to extend it as I was feeling good and realized I had some more time to kill. I think, I need to have a little longer run during the weeks as it might help with my recovery of my long runs as they are fine but I have felt it for days after the last couple weeks.
