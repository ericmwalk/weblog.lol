# beginning again weblogs

It works, but how does this work again?

With all of the new fun blogging tools that have been coming out lately, I have been wanting to try every single one of them, and I am probably still missing some of them. However, here are the ones that caught my eye, and I have tried two of them, and I know the other one would be amazing too:

- [Pika.Page](https://pika.page/) by the awesome people who make fun things at [Good Enough](https://goodenough.us)
- [Scribbles](https://scribbles.page) by Vincent Ritter, who makes some really cool projects that you should check out.
- [Gibber or Gibberish is the app](https://gibber.blog) - The idea of it being like text messages really is an interesting concept.

However, as I had been trying some of these and almost pulled the trigger to try the other one, I thought to myself. I still have this amazing weblog.lol site that I have not touched for a year that I should get back to. If anything, just to see what it is all about and what has changed, so maybe that is what I will do instead of diving too much further into the three listed above. In fact, as I was messaging [Barry Hess](https://bjhess.com) who helped create Pika.Page briefly about this exact topic, I found his response just refreshing when I said I am not sure I can fully switch to another platform:

> Not a problem! If you have something that fits the bill, of course, we’d love to have you along for the ride. But don’t force it!
>
> lets get this to WOOOOORK come on this has to do something......
