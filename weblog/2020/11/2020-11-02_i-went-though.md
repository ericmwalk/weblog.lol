I went though some time where I wasn't sure what book to read next and now I have about 5 in the queue and overwhelmed thinking if I will ever finish one.. ðŸ˜ƒ

The two current ones are [Adventures in Opting Out](https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Opting-Out-Leading-Intentional/dp/0316536946) and [Bears Don't Care About Your Problems](https://www.amazon.com/Bears-Dont-Care-About-Problems-ebook/dp/B07V2K4155/)
