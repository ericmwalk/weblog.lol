The episode is talking about my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">365 days of running a 5k every day</a>. I will give credit to Johnathan Ellsworth and Brendan Leonard the hosts for asking all the right questions to make an episode that was more than 15 min long as we joked about the start of the episode. I had a lot of fun chatting with them and feel privileged to have been on the show as I know they have had some amazing guests.

I hope you give the episode a listen and enjoy the conversation I had with them as I thoroughly enjoyed chatting with them. Finally, if you did enjoy it be sure to give their podcast a review on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/off-the-couch/id1453472927?mt=2">iTunes</a> to help show support for their show. I have only been a more recent listener and am enjoying it as it keeps me company while running and I really enjoy hearing all of the stories of their guests.
