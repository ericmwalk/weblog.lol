It might have been -14°F this morning but I felt like it was a good [challenge](https://www.strava.com/activities/3096146607) to conquer. If you dress right it isn't as bad as you think or looks on my frozen face. 🥶😁🏃‍♂️ Note I didn't take this photo this morning but actually almost a year go. I tried this morning but it was so cold when I took my phone out of my pocket it instantly shut off 🤷‍♂️..
