# Obsidian Thoughts ðŸ¤”

The more I have been using Obsidian as part of trying out Obsidian Publish, I actually think it could fit even more of just my everyday workflow and quite possibly replace how I use DayOne today. I primarily use DayOne as a notebook to capture a lot of different things, thoughts, notes, places, and things my kids have made or done. I guess as DayOnes purpose it is a digital journal that keeps both public things from my [micro.blog](https://ericmwalk.blog) site as well as personal things or things I just don't share. One of my favorite things about DayOne that currently can not easilsy be replaced in Obsidian is the ability to capture location data when a note is created or it is updated when you add a photo. I have seen some articles and support pages having this as a request but I haven't really found anything that will work that is just using a simple plugin. I think if Obsidian had a plugins that did this well or location data was built into the main program I would have to take an even closer look to just have Obsidian and cut out other note taking apps.
