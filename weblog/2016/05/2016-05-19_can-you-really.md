If you have kids you will definitely enjoy the first 10 min of the video as Mr. Kang Lee says <strong><em>we should celebrate when our kids start to lie</em></strong>.  <em>Wait... what!</em><strong>  </strong>I know but I don't want to spoil the video so watch it and hear what else he has to say on the topic.  Also, the best slide in the video is where he shows the accuracy of which groups of people (e.g., parents, parents of other kids, police officers, judges, child protection lawyers) can tell if a kid is lying.

<em><strong>After watching the video do you feel confident in being able to catch your kid or other kids lying?</strong></em>
