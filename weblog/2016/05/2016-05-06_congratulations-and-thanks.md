A "little" side project that some of you know about, <a href="https://bloggingmeetup.com/">Blogging Meetup</a> (formerly Bloggers Meetup), got some great news when it was featured on Wordpress's own Daily Post article talking about '<a href="https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2016/05/04/blogging-groups/">Stay Supported with a Blogging Group</a>'.  That was very exciting news for me and my co-founder <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160505045915/https://theroadtothere.live/2016/05/04/wordpress-featured/">Amanda</a> of the project.  For what started out based on some comments in a Blogging 101 course back on <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/24/community-bloggers-meetup.html">February 19, 2016</a>, is starting to really grow, grow, grow.

It is always a great feeling to know that something you have created is actually working, bringing people together, and having people find the end result useful.  In the same time, I hope <em><strong>every member</strong></em> of the Blogging Meetup is just as excited as we are as it couldn't have been done by ourselves.  It is every one that participates, encourages, supports each other, and talks to others about the Community.  Honestly, it would not/could not exist without all of the members doing those things or keeping conversations going.  Even if you aren't someone that participates in an active discussion on the site, I am guessing/hoping every now and then you have used the Index to find a new blog or clicked on someone's Blog liked on the chat page.  Participation doesn't need to be always commenting on the site as discovering other blogs is a big part of the whole experience.  That is where the Community effect comes into play and that is why I feel like we are doing something right.

So I want to give a big <strong>CONGRATULATIONS</strong> and virtual <strong>HIGH FIVE</strong> to everyone that has been, is currently, or in the future is planning on being involved in the Blogging Meetup Community.  This is still only the beginning as we continue to grow and try to figure out what works, what doesn't, and the bigger question of what's next.

One final note, I think there is a huge opportunity in the near future for the community to help support people taking the On-Demand Blogging U Courses.  We have bloggers of all different types/skills in our community and as I <a href="https://bloggingmeetup.com/2016/05/06/blogging-u-courses/">wrote this morning</a> on the Blogging Meetup, a big factor I joined those courses was for the Community.
