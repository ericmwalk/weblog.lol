Seeing how it is getting close to that time of year again for College Graduations, it reminded me of this video I saw a while back where <a href="https://twitter.com/sacca" target="_blank">Chris Sacca</a> gave an awesome Commencement speech to the Carlson School of Management back in 2011.

>"What’s success anyway? Is success about making the most money? No, money for the most part turns people into jerks." - Chris Sacca

There is so many good words of wisdom in the video that I wish I could have heard that exact advice when I was leaving school.  However, fast forward to today and I think the advice is still valid and the points that he is talking about are applicable no matter where you are in your life.

>"It all comes down to Happiness.  Happy people get jobs, happy people create, happy people win, happy people fall in love and raise family's, they lead and change the world. Happy people get what they want because often happy people realize they don't actually need much more than what they have and appreciate what they got.  Happy people are contagious." - Chris Sacca

I would really suggest you watch the whole video as there are a lot of good quotes and thought-provoking topics he touches on.  Four of the points stuck out to me as they are still so applicable today with everything happening in the world and how technology is continuing to change the way we do things and interact with people.  In the simplest form his words of advice and ultimately a way to be successful is ***Be Present, Be Helpful, Be Ethical and Be your Weird Self***.

Another one of my favorite quotes from the video was that around GPA as I also share the same view-point as him.  Hope you enjoyed the video.
