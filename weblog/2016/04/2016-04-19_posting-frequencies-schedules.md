# Posting Frequencies, Schedules and Drafts

Lately, I have not been finding the time to write much on here or even remember to post something that I have found interesting.  However, that is not to say I haven't started a bunch of different posts from time to time (this is one of those).

Today after looking back and removing a couple I still have 24 different draft posts waiting for me to either look at again and finish my thoughts or probably just delete them because I don't know what my original intent was.  Since most of the time, my blog is just about random thoughts and things that I find interesting it is easy to quickly capture it in a blog post for a later point in time with the "<a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/press-this/">Press This</a>" bookmarklet.  Also, if I have an interesting thought I want to share I can jot down a couple of notes and then pick it back up when I find time.  Since the theme of my blog is less of a daily journal and more of a place I keep interesting things and thoughts, I never feel the need to have a specific real-time event to post or something that happened to me recently.  Particularly, because most of what I do on a day-to-day basis probably isn't the most exciting and it would kind of get repetitive though I know there are moments in each day I will cherish.

With so many Drafts started you might be wondering why I don't find time to push the publish button more often and I think the reason is frequency.  A lot of times, a week will go by when I have lots of thoughts and interesting things I find and then there will be weeks I don't have as much to say or share at all.  My problem is the times that I have a lot of things I don't want to overload my blog with 10 posts in a week as I know the next week I might not have anything.  My intention is then always to posting some of what I found the next week or sometime after that, but it never really happens.  Hence, it would be smart of me to schedule some posts to automatically be posted out in the upcoming week(s).  One of the reasons I am hesitant to do that is that I keep thinking I might find something more timely relevant that I want to share and don't want to post too frequently.  Another reason is that I really like to hit that publish button even though it gives me multiple chances to review and re-review that probably take away more time than necessary to get my thoughts published.  I am still trying to work on a sustainable habit of writing/posting.  I am trying to find a groove that works but sometimes I feel like I have thought block and can't think of much to say or don't really want to share anything I have already.  I have thought the scheduled posting route might be worthwhile but haven't taken the plunge on it yet.

If you have made it this far thanks for listening to my random thoughts and of course I have a question for you.  **I am curious to find out how other people manage their blogs in terms of scheduling, frequency, and/or surplus of drafts?**   Also, for bonus points do you have a goal in mind as to how many posts you try to write/share in a given day/week/month?
