I saw this Inc. article last night by Shana Lebowitz called "<a href="http://www.inc.com/business-insider/best-way-to-break-bad-habit-ted-talk.html">This TED Speaker Has Revealed the Best Way to Break a Bad Habit</a>", and thought it would be fitting to share the TEDMED video that the article was referencing.  Judson Brewer is talking about Habits and the groundbreaking research his team discovered that can effectively help break bad habits.  Since I had a post last Friday titled "[Power of the Habit](https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/19/power-of-the.html)", I felt that this video seemed along the same lines and worth the share.
