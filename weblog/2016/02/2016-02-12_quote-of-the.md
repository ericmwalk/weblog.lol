>*"You weren't born to just pay bills and die."*

My wife sent me this quote the other day and it really made me reflect on things so I thought I would share.  I decided to put that quote on a photo I took while hiking with a good friend in Colorado a couple of years back.  In fact, my wife bought me the plane ticket to go see my friend for my birthday and looking back it was a great present as it got me to do what I had been talking about doing since I left college but kept saying to myself I was too busy.

I was more out of shape back then as I hadn't gotten into the swing of running again but it was well worth it once we made it to the top.  It was a gorgeous day and the view from the top of Estes Cone was awesome.  Luckily, the trail we took, which started at Longs Peak Trailhead, wasn't too strenuous and I would suggest it to anyone that finds themselves in the area.

Here are a couple other pictures I took from the peak, hiking up, and from the base of the mountain to give you a feel for how high up we were.
