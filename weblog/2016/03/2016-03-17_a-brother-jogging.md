I was telling my wife last night about how running at night sometimes plays tricks with your mind.  Most of the time it is when someone suddenly comes up out of nowhere and is walking/running at you, behind you, or just someone in the shadows of their house porch coughs or starts talking to someone on the phone.

That reminded her of this great video she shared with me by comedian <a href="http://michaeljr.com/" target="_blank">Michael Jr.</a> and I couldn't help myself but pass it along.
