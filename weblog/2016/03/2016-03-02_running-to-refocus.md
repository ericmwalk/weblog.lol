>Here it was 9:30 pm at night and I was just going to quickly finish writing a blog post I had started a couple of days back, but I was stuck and it felt like it was taking me too long to write.  It wasn't just flowing out like some of the ones last week did.  Then I realized that it is getting pretty late and I **really** wanted to get a run in tonight.

**So.... I went for a run.**

During my run, I reflected on how I have been having so much momentum with this blog and I should have just finished that blog post since I haven't made a post since last Friday.  Once I completed my run, feeling refreshed and motivated, I was reminded of a quote about why running appealed to Bernd Heinrich who was being interviewed in a video series titled "Why We Run" (video is at the end of this post).

>It appealed to me because I could do it all the time where every I was, no matter where I could always run. - Bernd Heinrich

This year as I have refound my love for running I have tried to embrace a quote like that.  I have been running on some cold days and very dark nights.  However, for me, it is time well spent and the motivation I feel from going for a run is just too good to pass up.  Now I know I didn't publish the actual blog post I was working on but I was stuck and needed to **run** away for a while.  In fact, as a result, of my run, I realized it helped motivate me to write/share something instead of having it feel forced.


**Now for a question, when you get writers' block, or writing seems slow, doesn't flow, or feels forced how do you get through it or refocus?**  Leave me your thoughts or tips in the comments as I would love to know how you refocus.
