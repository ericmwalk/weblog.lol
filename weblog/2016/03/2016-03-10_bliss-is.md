# Bliss is...

It is funny if you ask me what bliss is it would all depend on the day, time, and what I was thinking about at that moment.  In fact, it would also probably depend on what I was doing the hours leading up to the question.  The thing is there are different things in my life that are blissful.  On the one hand, like the picture above it is a breathtaking picture of some secluded place or a picture from the top of a [mountain](https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/12/quote-of-the.html), or seeing one of the [7 wonders of the world](https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/12/03/now-you-can.html), or just a picture of my family having fun enjoying the little things in life as well as the company of one another.

*What is your picture of bliss?*  Is it always the same or does it change as mine does depending on your environment?
