Seeing how school has just started for my kids I was reminded of this video I ran across a couple years ago.  There is a lot of good points in the video to ponder about specifically how the education system is structured today and where/how we are currently emphasizing specific topics.  I agree with the presenter that there is a problem with how the education system is structured today and the priorities that they are instilling in our youth.  It is something that is easy to point fingers as I feel everyone has an opinion on how the education system should be structured and what should be taught.  That is where it starts to break down though as there is too many opinions on it.  Additionally, it is something that can't be fixed overnight and has a lot of moving parts to the overall educational system.  That isn't to say nothing should be done, I think one of the problems and solutions is to just realize that education isn't a one size fits all as each person learns differently, is more interested in specific topics and on top of that learn a different paces.

***I would love to hear what your thoughts are on Education and Creativity.  Do you feel we have an issue today or are we doing the best we can?***

Hope you enjoyed this presentation as much as I did, here are two of my favorite quotes:

>"If you are not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original"

>We are educating people out of their creative capacities
