# Where the Heck is Matt? - 2016

With everything else that has happened in the last couple of weeks, I managed to miss that the new "Where the Heck is Matt" video that launched.  I am a big supporter of the work Matt Harding does mostly because I think the overall concept of dancing in all different locations is awesome.  Even though it is only a brief couple of seconds he shows himself dancing at different locations it goes to show you how the world is not always as scary as everyone makes it out to be.  He sums it up nicely in the caption of this new video by saying "We're stuck on this planet together and we need to take care of each other."
