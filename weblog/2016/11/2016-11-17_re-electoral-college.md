# Re: Electoral College

For anyone that found the last post on the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/11/11/electoral-college.html">Electoral College</a> interesting in any way, I felt that I needed to share this as a follow up as I stumbled across last Friday evening.  It appears there is more than meets the eye to the Electoral College as you will find out in the CGP Grey video below.

After watching the video it points out a couple more overall flaws that are part of our current system.  It is interesting to think that in the current system, in December the Electoral College could reverse the decision made by the "Public" (States Electoral Votes) a little over a week ago. I agree this would be bad to enact as it could cause a further divide in our country.

All of this is very interesting to point out as some of it I never knew before and honestly can't believe that we have a system in place today that allows it.  I do hope in the near future there are more discussions on what a modern election should look like.  I will be watching as all of this has really sparked my interest as well.
