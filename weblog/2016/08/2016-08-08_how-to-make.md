I stumbled upon this older TED talk (was recorded back in 2010) and felt it worth sharing. I think it is a topic is still very relevant today as most employers always talk about how they are giving employees great work-life balance. However, one point that <a href="https://nigelmarsh.com/">Nigel Marsh</a> points out is the following:

>Certain job, and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningful engaged on a daily basis with a young family. - Nigel Marsh

Seeing how I have a young family at home I can relate how each employees definition of what Work-Life balance should be and should look like can differ drastically. As I have only worked at a couple companies through out my career, I know each has had their own version of work-life balance and I would say each had good and bad parts to it.

>If you don't design your life someone else WILL design it for you and you may not like their idea of balance. - Nigel Marsh

For me, I work for a company that is fairly flexible in my opinion. I won't say everything is exactly how I would imagine my perfect day but they value family and that helps for where I am at in my life. I think for my personal situation it is trying to balance my own definition of how I want work/life to balance out on a daily, weekly, monthly basis given my situation, job, priorities. It is a constant balancing act between all of those points which is why there isn't a one size fits all solution and you just need to make the most of it.

***What is your definition of work-life balance?***
