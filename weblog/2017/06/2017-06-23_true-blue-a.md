# 'True Blue (A Short Story) by Eliot Peper'


<a href="https://www.amazon.com/True-Short-Story-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B072WZSWMZ/?tag=stthink-20">True Blue</a> a short story by a favorite author of mine Eliot Peper (<a href="https://twitter.com/eliotpeper">@EliotPeper</a>) just released yesterday.

I will first say this is one of the first short stories I have read because most of the time I have strayed away from them in the past. However, I am glad I read this one as it was the perfect size for me to digest in my normally busy week.  Not to mention I am a fan of  Eliot's work and this is another one that doesn't disappoint and couldn't put it down. Let's just say it was good for me that it was a short story. The main topic of the book is around discrimination but is set in a more future state. Even though this book is a short story Elliot masterfully writes it in great detail with various twists you might not see coming.

*I really can't say enough about the book and don't want to give too much of it away so go grab a copy as you can't beat the price as it only 2.99 (or free if you have Kindle Unlimited).  So go grab a copy today and start your weekend off right. *
