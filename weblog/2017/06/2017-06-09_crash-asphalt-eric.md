# Crash! Asphalt 1 - Eric 0

I had a great post for you a couple of weeks back I was in a slump about running and getting motivated to get out and run every morning.  I was thinking now that I am back at it 100% and fully motivated it would be a great time to share but then this happened this morning:

*Sometimes the ground wins*

That picture was taken well after the run, a painful shower, and three bandage changes later.  Though that wasn't it as I really twisted my ankle and have a couple bruised ribs (or that is what the doctor told me).  Also, my iPhone took a good fall on the pavement as I normally run with it and that was the arm that broke the rest of my fall.  Overall, nothing major was broken or damaged but I am a little slower moving today.

You might be wondering how this happened and I wish it was a much more glamorous story.  I was running along like normal on the sidewalk but on a rougher part of asphalt and my foot must have hit a dip wrong and my ankle twisted bad and there was no coming back from that.  I broke my fall with my hand for the most part that was under my chest.  I quickly rolled over into the grass and said some choice words to the sky as I knew my iPhone was on my arm that broke the fall.  I got up quickly as well and noticed a lady stopped in her vehicle asking if I was ok.  I said I was all good and started to jog off.  After two blocks and I knew I was dripping blood from my hand and knees I decided to stop and just walk the remainder of the way home as I also knew my ankle was tender but probably not broken.  On the walk home I realized I had a lot of pain in my chest as well which ultimately is probably bruised or cracked rib.

Sooo... stay tuned and I will still post it (probably Monday) as I might need some more motivation after I get all healed up.
