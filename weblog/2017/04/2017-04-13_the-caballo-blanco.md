For anyone who has read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Christopher-McDougall-ebook/dp/B0028MBKVG/?tag=stthink-20" rel="nofollow">Born to Run</a> or enjoys running, in general, needs to check out this series of videos that Ryan Van Duzer put together of his trek down to run the Caballo Blanco Ultra Marathon earlier this year.

> "You can't feel pain if your smiling... right?" - Ryan Van Duzer

That was a perfect quote he had at the very beginning and was fitting since he was smiling during what appeared to be the last couple of miles at the end of the video.  Honestly, being a runner myself, after watching this video I was ready to strap on my shoes and hit the trails.

Take note, not only is the feat of running 50 miles in a single time amazing but remember he did it all while carrying the video camera to capture this amazing event on film too.  If you are looking to be motivated you should definitely check this video out.
