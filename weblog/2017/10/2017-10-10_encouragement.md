# Encouragement

Sometimes things happen (<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/06/09/crash-asphalt-eric.html">Crash!</a>) and it is something that you don't or aren't really sure if someone is going to tell you to try again. Or give you that extra encouragement/voice you need to get back up and try it again. After that post, I wasn't up to what I had hoped for motivation as I struggled to motivate myself in the least.

My instincts were telling me to continue to plug away at this injury slowly and that it was for some reason important to overcome this so I could get out and run like normal. In July I tried again to just get out and run but honestly, I had even less motivation to do that as I blamed my upcoming family vacation and the extra work I needed to do prior to vacation as my crutch.

Then we were finally during the middle of our family trip to the East Coast, and something deep inside me had me throw in my running shoes. Thankfully I did as after nine days into the trip, our final day in Boston before we headed up to Maine, I laced up my shoes to hit the streets. For some reason, I was up really early and figured now is the time to get out and just run around the neighborhood and see the sights of this city I don't live in.

I am really glad I did! I was able to see the places I had seen the day before but with no one else in sight. In fact, it was just so peaceful out there if it wasn't that I wanted to get back to the hotel at a specific time I am not sure where I might have ended up.

That one run though helped start me on the path of getting out of my funk. In fact, it kind of reminded me that that is what helps me stay grounded. As I reflect back I was remembering the video I saw that I was going to post around the time of my Crash and was hoping to at a later point in time but completely forgot as I never really got out of that funk.

My example was getting me back to running and I will even say today I am finally feeling 100% back to normal running which is what I have been waiting to say for a long time. Everyone always has something to be down on, depressed about, or are just mopey about something. The challenge is trying to find something that works for you to get out of your current funk or mood.

>I have never gone on a run or a bike ride or anything outside and thought back to myself I shouldn't have done that, that was really dumb to go on a run. Never! It's always a good thing. - Ryan Van Duzer

The video I have included below by <a href="https://www.duzertv.com/">Ryan Van Duzer</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/duzer">@duzer</a>) is what I had watched right before my Crash! and there is some really good nuggets of insight and motivation that he offers while running in the hills of Colorado to get out of his own funk.

I can relate to his methods of remembering there is a whole lot of good things in life. Also, for me, one of the best ways for me to do that when things are stressful at work, home, or just something hard that I need to overcome, is that I just love getting out there to run. It clears my head and gives me a good start or end to the day.
