# Wordless Wednesday 05/03

*The only path to reach East Quoddy Light is at low tide so you can walk out there, but be careful (July 2004, Campobello Island, NB, CA)*

One of my favorite Light Houses to visit mostly because the hike out to the Light House has to be timed just right and you don't want to get stuck on one of the islands along the way.  Not to mention you can find lots of animals during that low tide that would otherwise be under sometimes 22 ft of water.

*East Quoddy Light as the locals call it or Head Harbor Light Station as found on most maps (July 2004, Campobello Island, NB, CA)*

*Starfish the size of your hand with a good sized Sea Urchin (July 2004, East Quoddy Light, Campobello Island, NB, CA)*
