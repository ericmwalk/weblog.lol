Another great/ timely video on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver talking again about Net Neutrality. Wait, what? Didn't he already make one of these?

Yes, you are correct and I included it below for you to watch again, but it is still serious. Equal access to online information is once again under serious threat by trying to come at it a different direction. So make sure you follow the instructions that he gave at the end of the video and voice your displeasure to the FCC by visiting <a href="http://gofccyourself.com">www.gofccyourself.com</a> and clicking "express" to file your comment.
