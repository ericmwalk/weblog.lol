I was on a good streak writing in this new form of Obsidian Publish as well as just tinkering around with everything to figure out what it is all about. however, for the last two weeks I really haven't been online much at all some by design and some just because there was a lot of things going on that needed to be done. 

As I was just looking at my DayOne journal I realized I have been using it quite a bit in 2024 since May. Some of that is because I have a daily shortcut that runs and adds some information about the day which is always a good start. Then I have some other shortcuts to put quick thoughs in that daily entry which helps as well. I do wonder though if for more daily entries like what I have been using DayOne for if Obsidian could fit the solution better. Some initinal thoughts are I can easily write daily posts just like this that I can chose to either sync to the web or not. Really it is as easy as marking the post to publish or not and if I set my setting to "false" then it will just live where it is in my Vault forever.

With all of that said there is a couple things in DayOne that I just really enjoy. Quickly the first one is that I can use GPS to tag locations of pictures taken on my run as well as just if I find an interesting spot when traveling I can open the note write something quick and there it is tagged with GPS as well as whatever I was thinking. So far I have not been able to find anything that can replicate that specifically in Obsidian but if they started to do some GPS support from the app itself and not from plugins which get messy I would probably just switch immediately. 

As for now I might let this experiment last a little longer as my month will be up in about a weeks time but I still do go back to how easy it is to get a post like this out online and then easily edit again after being published. Still does make a very compelling case to switch.
