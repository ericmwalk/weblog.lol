I felt like I had to make a quick [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/13317466266) along the water today. However, more sleep would have been better but after I woke up I could not fall back to sleep so i figured I would be productive. It would be interesting to hit this route sometime in the summer as I am sure it is a nice view then as well.
