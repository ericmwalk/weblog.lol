 Found a neat little photo app called [Cleanup Phone Storage Cleaner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cleanup-phone-storage-cleaner/id1510944943) that helped clean up some of my iPhoto Library as I have been dumping a bunch of old photos in there lately. Itâ€™s *Sumular* function I will say was not 100% perfect but I went back by years and found about 1500 per year from 2022-2017 and most of the time it was spot on finding where we took multiple pictures of our kids in a row which 50% were blurry, 30% they were not looking and then the last 20% were ok but probably 1 or 2 clear winners.
 
Going forward this will be less of a problem as I do a lot better job reviewing pictures from time to time as I have always been overwhelmed by the amount we took when camera phones were new. I love looking back at photos so even though this project is far from done it is nice to clear some of it out.
