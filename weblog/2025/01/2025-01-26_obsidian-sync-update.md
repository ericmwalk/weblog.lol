# Obsidian Sync Update

Let's just say it was a good run and test. I published a handful of posts about things I was finding out about it and honestly it is very slick if you are using Obsidian to quickly posts something online and it just works. I think one of the bigger downsides to me if someone wanted to use it as an actual blogging platform is that the RSS is really not great at all. I am sure there could be ways to get that to work better or you could spend the time curating something to work better there but that seems like more friction than I would want to do. Even though I didn't mention it earlier it is $8 per month if you pay for a year and that is kind of hefty in comparison to other blogging platforms you can find out there that are built more for well blogging. If you are looking for one I would check out one of the following
* **omg.lol** - For $20 a year you get access to all the great [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol)apps which are worth much more than that in my option. From a blog perspective you can use Adam's weblog.lol that is part of the $20 per year. However, you you might want to hold off till Adam is done creating [Neato](https://neato.pub) as it sounds well... Neato!
* **micro.blog** - There is a lot of apps you can get from Micro.blog depending on your subscription level. However, right now Manton has a new offering [micro.one](https://micro.one) that is $1 per month blog which is an awesome price and way to get people blogging.

In the end, between the RSS and honestly having too many blogging platforms that I pay for already (both above for starters) and don't always use I realized I didn't really need another place to just publish posts as I have worked so hard over the years trying to [combine things in one place](2022/01/05/all-in-on.html). So that is probably the biggest reason for ending the experiment.

However, with that said I did jump back into weblog.lol again as I wanted to see if I could get Obsidian synced up to make it easy to post there as I do with Micro.blog today. Once I get the setup I feel good about I will share that setup next, however, I get it migth be all for nothing once everything gets switched to Neato but that is OK, it helped me focus on something else this past week.
