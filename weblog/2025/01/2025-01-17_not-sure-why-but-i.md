Not sure why but I find this [article](https://geographicgeoff.substack.com/p/why-astoria-oregon-never-became-a) very interesting learning about Astoria, Oregon as well as hearing the coined term *"The Graveyard of the Pacific"* about the Columbia River. The best part is if you don't want to read the article you can watch the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyriUheSuCw&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fgeographicgeoff.substack.com%2F) instead.
