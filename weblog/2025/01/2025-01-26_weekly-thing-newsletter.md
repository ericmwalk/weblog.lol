# Weekly Thing Newsletter

If you are looking for a great Newsletter to sign up for I would highly suggest the [Weekly Thing](https://weekly.thingelstad.com) by [Jamie Thingelstad](https://www.thingelstad.com/). He does a great job of sharing interesting stuff he has read over the week with his own take.

This [week](https://weekly.thingelstad.com/archive/306/) specifically was pretty neat as well with the introduction of the 5 people whom he gifted a years subscription of blogging to as part of his "Christmas blogs". I forgot to comment about it when he first wrote about it but this was such a great idea as a way to get more people blogging. I checked each of them out and am now following 5 new people and it will be interesting to see what each ends up doing with their blog going forward.
