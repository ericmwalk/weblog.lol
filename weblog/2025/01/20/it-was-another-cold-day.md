It was another cold day but I was getting a little stir crazy sitting with no running and I couldn't go a third. So I decided to venture out for a short [one](https://strava.com/activities/13409794047) and it wasn't too bad since there was not much wind. Also, got my yearly Frozen Face so I can check that off my list.
