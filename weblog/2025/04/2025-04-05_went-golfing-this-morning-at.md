Went golfing this morning at the [Catalonia Caribe Golf Club, Punta Cana](https://maps.apple.com/?q=Catalonia%20Caribe%20Golf%20Club%0ACarretera%20Cabeza%20de%20Toro%0ALa%20Altagracia%0APunta%20Cana%0ADominican%20Republic&ll=18.617841,-68.373651). Over the years I donâ€™t really play much golf anymore but my son really wanted to play so we got up early to do 18 with some others and a golf pro.

The sky is bright blue, scattered with fluffy white clouds, creating a serene, tropical atmosphere.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-3035.jpeg)
