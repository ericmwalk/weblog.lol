Before this [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14285301823) I actually talked myself out of going up a mile this week thinking with everything going on I should take  rest. However, as I kept going I then got to a point that I thought what is 2-3 more miles.. Well those 2-3 miles you can see I was tired but glad to get the miles in.
