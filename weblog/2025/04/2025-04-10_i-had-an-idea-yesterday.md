I had an idea yesterday that I might have tried to squeeze in a longer run today but I worried I hadn't rested enough so I decided to just go out for a short [run](https://strava.com/activities/14140304883) today in between some meetings. I actually felt pretty good and the weather was nice and cool. I might regret not extending this run but glad to get a run in.

A small pond is visible in the mid-ground, reflecting the overcast sky. The background shows a distant tree line under thick, gray clouds, creating a calm and subdued atmosphere.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-3377.jpeg)
