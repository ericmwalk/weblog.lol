Needed to get this [run](https://strava.com/activities/14054892655) in before a early morning and day of travel. I didnâ€™t expect this amount of snow coming down, already down and the amount blowing in my face. Other than that it was pretty out in the night with bright white snow.

Snowflakes fall gently onto the ground, creating a serene and quiet atmosphere. The ambient lighting casts a soft, warm glow over the scene, adding a sense of tranquility to the winter landscape.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2572.jpeg)

The path is faintly lit, possibly by moonlight or another source, casting a soft glow on the snowy scene.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2574.jpeg)
