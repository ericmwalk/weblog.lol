I was hoping to have more time to get out for this [run](https://strava.com/activities/14177836150) today but meetings ran long and I only had a small window. Might be for the better as it was super windy out.

In the background, a house with a dark roof is visible through the trees. The sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the scene.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-3420-edited.jpeg)
