Work on some more additions to the already great [Micro.publish](https://micropublish.blog) and decided to add a toggle now for my note renaming (original plan) and then after getting images yesterday decided to figure out how to get GPT alt text support so I could elimiate an extra step I currently do today to post.
![Settings interface showing three options: "Delete images after upload," "Rename note after publishing," and "ChatGPT API Key (for alt text)" with toggles, two of which are activated.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/micro-publish-chatgpt.png)
