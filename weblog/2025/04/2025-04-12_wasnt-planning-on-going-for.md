Wasnâ€™t planning on going for a [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14160398010) tonight but it was great to convince my running friend to get out with me tonight. Honestly, that was the best part as it has been a while since we last ran so as I told him whatever the millage was going to be I was good with it.

![A straight, narrow railway track stretches into the distance, bordered by leafless trees on both sides. The ground is covered with gravel, and fallen branches lie scattered along the track. The scene has an overcast, wintery feel, with a grey sky overhead and sparse vegetation.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-3401.jpeg)
