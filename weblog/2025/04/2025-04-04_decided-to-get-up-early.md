Decided to get up early to catch the sunrise and have a slow [run](https://strava.com/activities/14077313794) around the resort. I think I have now traversed across the entire place.

The water is gently lapping against the sand, and shadows of palm trees line the edge of the beach. The sky is a soft gradient of warm colors, with a few scattered clouds.](https://walk.micro.blog/uploads/2025/img-2912.jpeg)
