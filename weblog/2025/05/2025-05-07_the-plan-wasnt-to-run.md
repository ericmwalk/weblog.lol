The plan wasnâ€™t to [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14411640784) today but seeing how my wider group at work is doing a step challenge I wanted to stay competitive. Looking at my watch I have been doing a lot of nothing today so I decided to get a couple thousand steps in in order to keep up. It was a beautiful night out so having that extra push was probably OK.
