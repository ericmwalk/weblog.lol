I probably should have done a really long [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14531917910) today but I wasn't really feeling it so I set out for shorter. However, the cool overcast weather allowed me to go a little further than I was thinking I would which hopefully should set me up for some good millage this week (weather dependent).
