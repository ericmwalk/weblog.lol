A meeting got canceled today so then my plan was to go out for a short [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14398115274) today after the long one yesterday. However, getting pressure from a company step challenge I decided to go my usual distance which actually felt really good until about the last mile was a struggle. Probably should have stuck with my first plan.
