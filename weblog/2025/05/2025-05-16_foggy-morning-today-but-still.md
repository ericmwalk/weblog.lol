Foggy morning today but still a great day for a [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14498451906) around Back Cove. I probably should have started earlier in the morning because by the time I got back I didnâ€™t leave myself a lot of time to get ready and jump on a call. Thankfully I made it with a min to spare.
