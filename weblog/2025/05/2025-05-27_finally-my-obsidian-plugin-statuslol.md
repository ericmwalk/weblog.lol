Finally, my Obsidian Plugin Status.lol Publisher got accepted to be out in the *wild* now and can be found in the community plugin section. ðŸ¥³ Now that it is approved I can make some other updates I had been waiting on as I didn't want to muddy the water during the approval and fixing what they wanted.
