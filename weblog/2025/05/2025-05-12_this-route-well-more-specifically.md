This route, well more specifically Mackworth Island State Park has been on my list to [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14461028518) to for a while now. It was very interesting roaming around that little park as it had a nice trail all around the outside. In fact there was a Pet Cemetery for Governor Baxter Dog's. ðŸ¤”

Three small, weathered gravestones stand to the right of the boulder, partially covered in moss. Bare trees and sparse undergrowth are visible in the background. The ground is covered with dirt and fallen leaves.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-3744.jpeg)
