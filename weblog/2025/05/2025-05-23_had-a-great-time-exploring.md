Had a great time exploring [Sunfish Lake Park](https://maps.apple.com/?q=Sunfish%20Lake%20Park%0A3554%20Kelvin%20Ave%20N%0ALake%20Elmo%20MN%2055042%0AUnited%20States&ll=45.003662,-92.904915) after getting something checked on vehicle. Wasn't really the plan but glad I had some [running](https://www.strava.com/activities/14573193107) gear to go check out this out of the way park. Honestly, when on the trails I felt like I was no where near anything as I was all alone.
