Don’t be fooled by this shady part as the rest of my [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14853409223) felt like the opposite of cool but more close to melting in the sun. I don’t think I’m used to the heat yet as my body definitely would not have been ready for the long run and envisioned in my mind so I was happy to get done what I got done.
