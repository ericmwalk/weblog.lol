Been a long time since I have done a long [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14689989284) late in the evening. The goal was to start earlier but things pushed it back. When I finally started I decided to just go with it.  Wasnâ€™t bad overall air quality and temp was good, legs felt heavy in the last stretches and it was really dark.
