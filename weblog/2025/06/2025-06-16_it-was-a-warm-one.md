It was a warm one out there tonight on this [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14821961434). However, I did notice on this trail these signs look new almost like they might really be serious now. Well for another day as it makes no sense the other side of the tracks is the actual trail. üõ§Ô∏è

Also found another looked like trail to this dead end.
