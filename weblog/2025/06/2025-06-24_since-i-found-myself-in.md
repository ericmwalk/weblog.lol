Since I found myself in the right place today I was glad to have tossed in my [running](https://www.strava.com/activities/14906231892) shoes so I could go exploring and start collecting some [612 POAPs](https://www.thingelstad.com/projects/612-poap-challenge/). Hindsight, I should have looked closer at the map where they were (missed some) and been aware of road/bridge closures as I ended up adding more miles than planned.
