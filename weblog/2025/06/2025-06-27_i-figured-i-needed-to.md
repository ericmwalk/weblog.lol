I figured I needed to start this long day off right with a [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/14933071444) even though it didnâ€™t feel as smooth as I would have liked it to. Might have to consider the rest of the weekends millage and see what makes sense as I have rain and heat to potentially deal with.
