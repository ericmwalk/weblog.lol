Plan B for tonight we decided to  goto a site I have been before and [meandered](https://www.strava.com/activities/15064084363) around the historic trails at the old Bloomington Mill site. Had fun even though it was a lot of work. There is so many trails and old wooden steps into this valley that are no where on a map so you have to look closely.

![A wooden bridge with metal railings stretches over a small stream. The bridge entrance is blocked with red netting and a "Bridge Closed" sign. Erosion is visible near the concrete base by the water. Surrounding the bridge are lush green trees and bushes.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-4752.jpeg)
*I am never a good rule follower so this might have said bridge closed but we still made it over and back.*

![A serene landscape of lush green fields and dense forests under a clear blue sky, with trees casting gentle shadows at the foreground edges.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-4754.jpeg)
*View from the top of the valley at one point*

![A small waterfall flows over a stone barrier into a calm river, surrounded by lush green trees and vegetation. A stone path with a fence is visible to the left, curving along the riverbank.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-4758-edited.jpeg)

*Some steps that are kind of blocked off but not really blocked off ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è*

![A lush forest scene with tall trees, dense green foliage, and a dirt path winding through the undergrowth. A fallen tree trunk lies on the forest floor, surrounded by leaves and rich vegetation.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-4756.jpeg)
*Trust me this is a path to the bottom even though it just looks like dirt there are some rail road tie steps in there.*
