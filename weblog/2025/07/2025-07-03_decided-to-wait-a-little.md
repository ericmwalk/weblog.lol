Decided to wait a little bit to get outside this morning so I didn't wake the rest of the house and it gave me time to wrap something up for work. Both of those things were good but I regretted it when I actually started [running](https://www.strava.com/activities/14994975403) and realized how warm it was (*yes I am a baby about the heat*).
