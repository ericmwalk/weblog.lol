Got out earlier today again which I am glad I did before my day took hold of me with other things. Weather to the side I felt good out there and had the time to go for a little longer [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/15047197043) than originally planned.

*Quiet street that gave me some tree coverage from the sun.*
