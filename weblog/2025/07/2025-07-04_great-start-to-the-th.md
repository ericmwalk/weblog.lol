Great start to the 4th of July again this year by doing a little [5K](https://www.strava.com/activities/15010483718) with my kids, niece, and nephews. I tried to keep up with the older kids which meant I never saw them until .5 miles left when the heat/lack of training overtook them and I could pass them on these old legs.
