After my run tonight came home to play some  Pickleball in the driveway. Starting getting dark so we had to use the Jeep for some extra lighting. The kids seem to be getting into it again  so we might have to hit up the new courts at Miller Park.

![A group of four people stand together outdoors at dusk, each holding a pickleball paddle. They are smiling, and the scene is illuminated by a car's headlights in the background.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-4620.jpeg)
