â€‹What start out in hopes to match last weeks total distance I really tried to gear myself up for a 7-8 mile [run](https://strava.com/activities/13708348135). A rough start which I had thought about turning around a couple of times I actually ended up extending it and hitting double digits. The nice weather today was some great motivation.
