It was a nice day out today so decided to get a  [run](https://strava.com/activities/13689531128) in probably against my better judgement. However, I feel like I found what seems like a trail or old road don't you think? It seemed to stop so I turned around as I didn't want to get my shoes too wet but might have to explore again another time.
