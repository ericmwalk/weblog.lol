# Shed Office Heating Upgrade

On a whim last week I decided I needed to get a little more heat flowing in the *Shed Office* as the electric heaters I have works great until the temps at night get down to -10ÂºF as it is a little too much for them to keep up even blasting all night (which I don't love doing). So some mornings I would wake up to 32ÂºF in the shed and if when I woke up I turned the heaters on it would take some time (sometimes half the day) to get the shed to a OK temp of in the high 40ÂºF so I could come out and then work. Because of that somedays I would just bail and try to work from the house.

A couple weeks back I got a email with a deal on a mini propane heater that is for "Indoor / Outdoor use", however in the fine print is it **ONLY** supposed to be used indoors in an Emergency. After considering it I decided to pick one up as it was not overly expensive. Also, yes, heating my *Shed Office* so I can work is an emergency ðŸ˜†. The heater is pretty basic as it is just a radiant propane heater instead of a forced air one so the nice thing is I can keep my other heaters going and not draw any other electricity. In a way it might have been nice to have one with a blower, I have actually been happy with how this is working with out a fan.

After using it from time to time over the course of the past week, it has been just great. I mean today is a great example where I forgot to have the electric heaters stay on longer last night as I normally have them reduce the temp overnight in an attempt to not just waste electricity. However, seeing how it got in the the negative temperatures last night I woke up this morning to a 32ÂºF shed. So after I got our youngest on the bus I went out to fire up my mini propane heater. In the course of the next hour that I let it run it increased the temperature from 32ÂºF to 57ÂºF which is more than comfortable for me.

*Just to note, I do not leave this on over the night and it is only used to kind of get my shed to a warm state when I am nearby. Otherwise, I keep everything off and propane tank is off too.*
