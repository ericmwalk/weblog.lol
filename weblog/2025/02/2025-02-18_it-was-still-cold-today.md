It was still cold today but decided while my oldest daughter and two friends practiced dryland for hockey I would try to get some miles in. Overall, it wasnâ€™t bad on the [run](https://strava.com/activities/13663195075) and I felt good. I mean yes it was cold out but I was bundled up so all was good.
