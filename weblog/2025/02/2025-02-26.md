Such a nice day out again today. So I decided to take the time I had and extend this [run](https://strava.com/activities/13734379735) a little bit further.

The foreground is framed by the branches of the trees, creating a natural archway that opens up to the expansive field.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2137.jpeg)
