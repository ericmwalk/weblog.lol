Against my better judgement I went out for a [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/13594746811) today telling myself I am back at 100% but I knew this was not true. I felt good moving more today and it was a little later in the morning which probably helped as well. However, I am thinking I might regret this discussion when I crash tonight.

*Looks close at this photo and you will see a van driving towards me on this path. Yes, it is a bike/walking path not a road. Before I got to the bridge after taking this photo, they started reversing realizing their mistake or I guess they didn't want to run me down.*
