Such a nice day out with 50Â°F out for a recovery [run](https://strava.com/activities/13717855647) after a longer run yesterday. Even though it was overcast it felt great out as I wore shorts again in this weather. However, it was very wet outside as I feel like before the end of the week all the snow might be gone in the neighborhood.

![A wet, paved path stretches into the distance under an overcast sky, flanked by barren trees and dry grass. Patches of melting snow are visible on either side of the path, with a pile of tan material and black erosion control tubes lining the ground. A road sign in the upper left indicates a speed limit of 25 MPH.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2120.jpeg)
