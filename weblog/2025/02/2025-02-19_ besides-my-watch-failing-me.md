Besides my [watch](https://ericmwalk.blog/2025/02/19/well-first-for-a-long.html) failing me today on this [run](https://strava.com/activities/13675185674), I couldn't complain as it was sunny out and warmer than the other day. However, by cutting out when I did for it meant I needed to work now that everyone is heading to bed but I think it was worth it to keep the calm.
