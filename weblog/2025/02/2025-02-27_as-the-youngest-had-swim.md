As the youngest had swim tonight I decided to use all the light I could to get out for a [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/13750421959). However, it eventually turned dark and I found some interesting glows in the sky. ðŸ˜„

In the sky, there is a circular pattern of lights creating a glowing ring, illuminating the clouds around it. The overall atmosphere is mysterious and serene.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2150.jpeg)
