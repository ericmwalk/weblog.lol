Planned to take a little time off this morning to do my yearly birthday [run](https://strava.com/activities/13975287206). It got a little delayed for work stuff but I did make it out. I didn't plan for it to be as cold as it was when I started but it is a good start to another year around the sun.

Bare tree branches extend over the right side of the image, while a lone duck is visible on the water. The opposite shoreline is bordered by a line of leafless trees.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2505-edited.jpeg)
