Well I see that Eden Prairies approach to all the snow on the sidewalk is to not touch it more than 30 hours later and just hope that it all melts. Thankfully my [run](https://strava.com/activities/13808765588) took me to Chanhassen and Minnetonka which have decided to shovel so I don't get hit by cars.

A road runs parallel to the field, with houses and trees lining the opposite side. Bare trees and evergreens are scattered throughout the background under a clear blue sky.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2213.jpeg)
