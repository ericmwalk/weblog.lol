Shorts and tee shirt weather today on this [run](https://strava.com/activities/13884064036) back in Minnesota. It was super nice out today and just wanted to get a couple miles in this afternoon before the weekend. However, my only mistake was I thought I should hit a couple of trails in the conservation place and lets just say I tried to make the quickest exit possible with out back tracking as it was muddy.
