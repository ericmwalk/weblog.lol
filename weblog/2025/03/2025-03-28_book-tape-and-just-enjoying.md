book tape and just enjoying the beautiful weather and scenery I almost forgot to take a picture today on my [run](https://strava.com/activities/14015414835). So I took a rather odd one mostly because I don't think I have noticed this little stream in-between buildings and not sure where it comes and goes to.  ðŸ¤·

![A narrow stream runs through a wooded area with leafless trees on both sides. The ground is covered with brown leaves, and the stream reflects the bare branches above. The scene has a calm, wintery atmosphere, with muted colors and a gentle curve where the water flows.](https://walk.micro.blog/uploads/2025/img-2522.jpeg)
