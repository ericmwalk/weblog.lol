Over the weekend to help me get to the shed office without completely jumping from dry ground to try ground I tossed some boards from the rink to make a little walkway. Only to find out today with the rain and more ice melting I did not make this boardwalk long enough. ðŸ™„

To the left, there is a partially constructed hockey rink with a net set up on the grass nearby. The area is surrounded by leafless trees and other houses.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2189.jpeg)
