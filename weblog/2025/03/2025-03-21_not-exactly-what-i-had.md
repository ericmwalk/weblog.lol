Not exactly what I had planned for today. I created really interesting route that I wanted to try only to wake up and find it pouring rain outside. I decided to scrap my actual route as it would have been had me being outside for a lot longer in this cold rain and just tried to [run](https://strava.com/activities/13944834859) along the water. Only the construction along the trail caused that to be derailed slightly as well.

![A paved pathway runs alongside a body of water under an overcast sky. There are street lamps evenly spaced along the path, and benches are placed intermittently on the grass adjacent to the path. The area appears wet, indicating recent rain, with puddles visible on the path. The landscape is flat, with distant trees and landforms on the horizon.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2479.jpeg)
