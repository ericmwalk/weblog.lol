Decided to take big Darbs for a longer than normal walk today enjoying the snowfall. 🌨️🐶

![A black dog stands on a snow-covered path during a light snowfall. The path winds through a wintery landscape with bare trees dusted with snow on either side. The ground is lightly covered with snow, and the dog appears to be on a leash, looking back towards the camera.](https://walk.micro.blog/uploads/2025/img-2552.jpeg)
