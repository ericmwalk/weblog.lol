I decided to shovel a path to my “shed office” this morning but ended up having to make two paths at a point because under the very direct route was lots of water so I had to find the make shift boardwalk I built.

A snow-covered hockey net is visible on the right, and trees with bare branches are dusted with snow. A vehicle is partially visible in the background. The scene is serene and wintry, with soft light illuminating the snow.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2202.jpeg)
