I was glad to get this [run](https://strava.com/activities/13872865937) in today as I fell like I would have been disappointed if I didnâ€™t wake up early again to make it to the back cove area. I think ever since I started working out there I have always made that loop at least once.

The sky is beautifully colored with shades of orange, pink, and deep blue, reflecting on the rippling water below. A large cloud formation is prominently visible, adding depth to the scene.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2349.jpeg)
