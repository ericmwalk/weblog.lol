Glad to have actually pushed myself out the door today to get a [run](https://strava.com/activities/13858227117) in this morning. Once done I felt great and even though it was cloudy today it is never a bad day running on this path along the water.

![A coastal pathway runs alongside calm water, bordered by a rocky embankment. The path, lined with streetlights and benches, curves gently into the distance. The landscape is covered with patchy grass and sparse shrubs under a cloudy, overcast sky.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2330.jpeg)
