Another week in Maine and another loop around the Back Cove in the morning hours. Even though I could probably sleep in more when I travel here it is hard to pass up a nice morning [run](https://strava.com/activities/13925263432) along this path. 

![A tranquil scene at sunrise with a long pier extending over calm water. The sky is a gradient of soft orange and blue hues, reflecting on the water surface. In the distance, there's a structure with triangular shapes, and a bird can be seen flying in the clear sky. The overall mood is peaceful and serene.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2467-edited.jpeg)
