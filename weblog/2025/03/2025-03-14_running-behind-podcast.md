# Running Behind Podcast

A friend of mine, Joey Metzger, has jumped into the podcast game with [Running Behind](https://podcasts.apple.com/kw/podcast/running-behind/id1795706178). On top of already making great [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Run_Joey_Run) about his running adventures, he decided to take things further and launched the *Running Behind* podcast about a month ago. There is now, three episodes out there now that are fantastic and after catching up with him a couple weekends go for a run, I can say the guest lineup is only getting better.

Maybe selfishly, but the latest episode titled **["Eric Walker | "The Streak", Running For Fun & Digestible Numbers"](https://podcasts.apple.com/kw/podcast/eric-walker-the-streak-running-for-fun-digestible-numbers/id1795706178?i=1000698989093)** *(released just yesterday)* will always stand out to me as the best by far because as you can tell Joey let me join him for a discussion about running. I had such a great time chatting with him, especially since, as you’ll hear, we hadn’t caught up in a long time. In fact, it was only about six months ago that we reconnected as we found each other on Strava *[(Joey's Strava Profile)](strava.com/athletes/111237895)* and then realized that we are both crazy runners. *Though, to be fair, he might be the crazier one as he runs much longer distances and sticks almost entirely to trail races.*

I won’t spoil too many details of our discussion because you should give it a listen. We talked about my running history, especially my 5K a day streak from 2018, but with Joey being the great host he is, he managed to dig out new stories and other takes on running.

I really do appreciate that Joey let me join his show and I hope he still has listeners for your next episode after this past one.
