Glad to be back home [running](https://strava.com/activities/13969616329) on some familiar trails again. Decided to put in a short one before everyone was hungry for brunch and basketball games started up again.

![A wooden boardwalk leads through a vast, dry field of tall grasses under a cloudy sky. Sparse trees and bushes are scattered across the landscape, with more dense trees visible on the horizon. The sky is overcast, casting a gray hue over the scene, creating a tranquil and open natural setting.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2500.jpeg)
