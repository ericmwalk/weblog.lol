I wasn't sure I was going to make it out today but I noticed that it wasn't going to be an overcast day so decided to get at least a short [run](https://strava.com/activities/13860650727) in before another long day in the office.

A large crane is visible on the horizon, illuminated against the fading light. The shoreline on the left is lined with trees, and the overall scene reflects a serene waterfront landscape.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2333.jpeg)
