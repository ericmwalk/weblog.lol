It was a long day of work today with some other kid stuff sprinkled in as well. I kept just thinking I would take a day off but honestly I needed this time to [run](https://strava.com/activities/13988383290) as the sun was setting tonight. I told myself finally OK, just do 3.1 miles and so I just started running.

The silhouettes of the trees create a serene and peaceful atmosphere.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2512.jpeg)
