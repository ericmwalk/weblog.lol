 This [run](https://strava.com/activities/13819208691) was not a stellar one at all. It was one of those runs I should have probably stopped two blocks in and called it a day to just take the rest that my body seemed to be asking for. However, instead I pushed though and ended with a little ankle pain. ðŸ«£

The ground is covered in snow, and the horizon shows a soft gradient of colors transitioning from light blue to hints of orange and pink. The scene conveys a serene, quiet atmosphere typical of late winter afternoons.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2218.jpeg)
