It was a rainy and cool one out this morning as I meandered around the bay and then town of Portland. However, not too cold that I could [run](https://strava.com/activities/13935185919) with shorts today so a win in my book.

In the foreground, an orange "Road Work Ahead" sign is visible beside a fallen traffic cone. Streetlamps line the path, casting warm light in the misty atmosphere. Sparse trees and additional buildings are visible in the background.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2474.jpeg)
