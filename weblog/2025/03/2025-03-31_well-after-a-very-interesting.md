Well after a very interesting day of trying to work with no official work laptop. I was ready to get this long [run](https://strava.com/activities/14044382245) in before we head out on vacation. I want sure how this one would feel so late in the day but it was great to get out and chase the sunset.

The sky is clear with a few scattered clouds, and the bright sun casts long shadows across the landscape.](https://walk.micro.blog/uploads/2025/img-2559.jpeg)
