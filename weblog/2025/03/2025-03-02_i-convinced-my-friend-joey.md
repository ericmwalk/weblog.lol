I convinced my friend [Joey](https://www.strava.com/athletes/111237895) to let me [run](https://strava.com/activities/13772484973) with him for a while around Hyland so I could get some elevation today. We split off after a while and I went solo the rest of the way which might have been a mistake as it was then much longer than planned as I might have gotten lost along the way.

A building and a red snow grooming machine are located at the base of the slope. In the background, there's a cityscape that includes several buildings and clear blue sky. The scene is bright and sunny, indicating a clear day.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2025/img-2167.jpeg)
