# School lunch with the Boo… 👻
Decided to change my plans today and surprise this girl for lunch today 😁. She had been begging us for the last month now that visitors can come into the school and seeing how this is the last week of school it had to get done.

I think the other kids were quite jealous of the food I brought because she said ***everyone*** else’s parents bring this. Come to find out they all want it but no one brings it. 😆

It is interesting to think that she is in 1st grade and almost done with this year and I have never really been in her classroom. Some of it is she it at a different school than her siblings but also with COVID protocols the past 2 years we were never really allowed in the school much. So it was also fun for me to see where they eat lunch and the hallways she walks down every day.
