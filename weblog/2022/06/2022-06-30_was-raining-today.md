Was raining today but wanted to get out for a [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/7400219369) mostly to explore Porcupine Mountains. The trail was interesting and at first I felt like it just wasnâ€™t maintained by the fallen tree but eventually I was a on a very small boardwalk that eventually turned into a muddy mess.
