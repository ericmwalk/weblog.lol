A couple of weeks back we finally said goodbye to our RV as we watched drive out of our driveway for the last and final time. It was a bittersweet decision to sell as we cherish all of the memories the big beast brought our way. It won't be the end of our camping journey though but it is just another chapter. We decided that the kids enjoyed our seasonal campground site and it didn‚Äôt make sense to park an RV on it so we decided to settle in with a travel trailer that would give us a little more space and can just sit there year round!

*Really will miss that specific site at the seasonal spot though, there is not another one like it on the property where you can be almost isolated. However, it is an RV only site so we had to move on.*
