Didn’t go as planned but I am ok with it. Only time to start [running](http://www.strava.com/activities/7825374548) was right after a dinner on a full stomach as my family was in town. Got about 3 miles in and my backpack broke. Then it obviously got dark which isn’t fun to run in the dark for so many miles but it is done and close to the plan.
