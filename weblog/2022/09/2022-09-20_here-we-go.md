# Here we go again...

After having a couple of my running friends twist my arm I finally signed up for the Twin Cities Marathon again. However, it wasnâ€™t just because of their insistent pushing me to do it but I realized that due to COVID and not having a marathon in 2020, this is the 40th year of the Twin Cities Marathon. I [documented](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html) how I ran it last year and before that it was 20 years ago. So it should have been the 40th running last year of the Twin Cities Marathon and that would have been even cooler to say I did it when I turned 40. However, that ship has mostly sailed but there is something neat about running both the 20th and 40th Twin Cities Marathon. I might not be as trained as last time as a lot has happened this year but I should be trained enough or at least better than I was at the 20th ðŸ˜‰.
