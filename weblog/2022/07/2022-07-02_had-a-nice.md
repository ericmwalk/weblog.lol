Had a nice [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/7402699967) into Bayfield on the [Brownstone Trail](https://landmarkwi.org/brownstone-trail-updates/). The section I was on might have been closed as I noticed a sign I blew past as well as a fence I hopped but the views were great along the water. Mostly due to erosion as there was some quick footwork in places but I sure hope they are able to preserve it.

*This would be where there was some erosion and obviously no one has used this trail in a while.*
