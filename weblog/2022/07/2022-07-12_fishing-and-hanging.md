# Fishing and hanging out at the farm üé£üöú

This past weekend we went down to the Gott Family farm in small town [Ollie, Iowa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie,_Iowa). It is a little bit of a hike to get there from where we live but the kids loved every minute of it as they get to do all the things they don‚Äôt do in the cities (e.g., ride tractors, 4-wheelers, and have a personal finishing pond). I am pretty sure if you couldn‚Äôt catch a fish in this pond something is really wrong.

As you look though and see the size of the fish you will realize that they seemed to be well fed. Especially when the Grandkids are around.

**Fishing**

I feel like everyone caught a lot of fish. Unfortunately only one person got the luck job of taking the fish off and putting a new worm back on üôÑ.

On our long drive back we stopped off quick to see my parents and played a round of ‚ÄúGolf‚Äù
