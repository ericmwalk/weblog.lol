I really do love snowy days like today. I was just thankful it was still snowing this afternoon so I could go for a [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/8252847915) while listening to my favorite [podcast](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/) that dropped this morning. Also, decided to hit up a trail to really blaze a path through the snow, a good way to end the day if I say so myself. 🌨🏃‍♂️
