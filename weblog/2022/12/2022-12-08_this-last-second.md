This [last second shot](https://www.espn.com/core/video/iframe?id=35213945) by Ohio state to pull off a win by one point is amazing. What they donâ€™t show right before this is a free throw missed that could of if anything tied it up. However, looking closer at the video you will see the shooter is out of bounds and then comes back into play.  Everything happened so fast no one was the wiser. To bad that was missed but honestly, it was a great shot and impressive that they got it off in such a short time.
