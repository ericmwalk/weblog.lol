Run felt good tonight after the weekend run. My daughters asked me in the middle of the [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/7722893386) for cake mix. Which of course I said I would figure it out. Guessing I looked kind of funny carrying a box of cake mix and frosting for the last 2 miles.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
