For a minute I was thinking of taking this familiar trail but the heat / humidity was kicking me. I thought [running](http://www.strava.com/activities/7734104494) when the sun went down would be better tonight but I was wrong. Fun catching up with my neighbor afterwards but I am guessing the beers didn’t do me any benefits.😁
