# Grocery Shopping Run

I like how well the Apple AirPods just work with my iPhone. Only over the last year have I switched almost all of my personal devices back to [Apple devices](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/08/20/new-devices.html) and today I was reminded why it just makes sense and it just works.

With the upcoming weekend, I had a block of time this morning that I could get a longer than normal done during the workday. Since we are camping this weekend I wasn’t sure what the long weekend would bring.

I only got about 1.5 miles into my run this morning when I got the text (*that was conveniently spoken to me*) from our Grocery shopper that they are going to start shopping for us. *I am not sure why my wife put my number for them to contact but it probably works as I am in front of a computer most days and she is a teacher in front of kids.* However, I was able to respond easily to the shopper on her questions about substitutions for the entire run. I never had to stop once to grab my phone out and respond and I was listening to a Podcast in between the times that she would ask me another question. It was honestly just so simple to listen to what she asked me and then say “**reply**” and respond with my answer. I exchanged 10 messages with her until she finally sent me the note saying she was done and I would get an email shortly. This was conveniently 1 mile before I was done and I was ok with the fact that all of this happened as I was doing something else. I didn’t have much else going on during that run but I would have been frustrated if I would have had to stop every mile and try to respond to her on my phone instead of just plugging away at the miles while *texting* her back.

Times when technology works the way it is intended (or maybe not intended) for me just blows my mind. Some people probably would not enjoy such a disruption as I had today but I didn’t mind it at all as I might have otherwise been stuck with groceries I didn’t want or ones I would have happily taken a replacement for but never responded to say so.
