Well this was quite the embarrassing find digging for something in a closet upstairs….. Yep this is 41 unopened Christmas cards 🫣😵‍💫

I will say I did enjoy opening them and reading and seeing pictures of family and friends. Guess it got too crazy in December I didn’t even notice that we got way less than normal 🤷‍♂️

*We will do better next year and sorry to all of those people whose cards we didn’t open up till now*
