This is really nitpicky but honestly, the worst part of being stuck inside with COVID is I am missing my outdoor running time. I probably *could* go do it but I think the **smart** decision and with the [current weather](https://darksky.net/details/44.8569,-93.4602/2022-1-20/us12/en)... I should stay inside and find something else to do ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚.
