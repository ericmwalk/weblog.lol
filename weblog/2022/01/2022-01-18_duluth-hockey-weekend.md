# Duluth Hockey Weekend

Had such a great weekend watching this our #11 and her team play their hearts out. Not to mention they all just had fun hanging out as much as they could and still being as safe as they could.

Overall, they won 2 and lost 2. On a personal note, our #11 Madiana scored 2 goals of which another parent had a great video from behind the net showing her picking up the rebound!
