It has been over a week since I have worked out and I think the lingering COVID virus made this [3.3 Mile](http://www.strava.com/activities/6575165776) run feel like it was much longer. Might have to keep easing back slowly this week. Didn’t help my attitude out there as I kept running into Trail Closed signs 🙄🏃‍♂️
