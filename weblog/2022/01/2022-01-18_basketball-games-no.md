Glad we were able to make it back to the cities after an out of town [hockey weekend](https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/18/duluth-hockey-weekend.html) in time to see our favorite basketball boy play his last game of the day! Their team was short players this weekend, so a fearless five boys rocked back-to-back-(to-back🤪) games without breaks or subs. They only lost one game by 2 points and won the other two (one of which was by 12 points). Overall, they played great!!! 🏀🤩
