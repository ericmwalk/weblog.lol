# 7th Grade State Champions üèÄ‚õπÔ∏èüèÜ

Wow! All four games over the weekend were down to the wire last second buzzer beater games! The point differential in total was 8 (2,2,3,1 in that order). Proud of their team for not giving up as most of the games we came back from 8-10 points down but they played tough and didn‚Äôt give up. I am pretty sure all of us adults aged a bit more after those games.

My wife and I couldn‚Äôt attend the final 2 games on Sunday as we were at a Dance Competition for our two girls. A big thanks to to Papa Walker (my Dad) for being our in-person cheer squad while we watched via livestream from the girls‚Äô dance competition. *(Apologies to the dancers on stage as our group let out an audible cheer at the buzzer beating victory!!! üôâ)*

What a great way to end the season and it is sad that the season has now come to an end. It has been fun watching these boys play together. They had a very successful season (28-12) despite all the sicknesses, and injuries. As I was the official / unofficial stat keeper here are some interesting facts.

- 1st Place in 3 tournaments
- 2nd Place in 2 tournaments
- 3rd Place in 1 tournaments
- 40% shooting percentage vs opponents 35%
- One tournament they only had 5 kids to play (no subs) and only lost one game
- Out of the 40 games only two kids were at all of them (one being my son)
