We found out poor Lainey Lou the Doodle has Addisonâ€™s Disease. ðŸ˜“ðŸ’” Poor girl started treatment Friday with her first injection and will be closely monitored in the weeks and months to come. Not sure if we are watching her to close but she seems off with the meds. Luckily the vet caught it before it could have been a problem.
