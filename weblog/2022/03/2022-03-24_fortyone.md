# Forty-one

Another trip around the sun for me as I flip my internal digits to **41**! As I am sitting down in these morning hours, hoping the kids will sleep in longer as they are on Spring Break, I am actually struggling what to write. It isn‚Äôt that I don‚Äôt know what to write but there was actually a lot of things that happened and I know I won‚Äôt capture them all or well enough in this entry. I am still working from home for the most part which is a blessing some days and a curse other times.

However, using past entries as a guide I will follow up on some things I alluded to last year and just talk about other things.

Year two with the RV was much like the first but a little less camping this year as we didn‚Äôt know what to expect with kids camps and stuff coming back. We never made it on a real long roadtrip but we visited a couple new places and old ones. I will say even though it is a chore getting the rig ready and cleaned out it seems like once we are at a place everyone enjoyed their time.

It was my 40th this past year I had some big things planned in the area of running.... The good thing is I did complete the [Twin Cities Marathon](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html) that I did 20 years ago that day which was just a fun accomplishment in my mind.

*My crew really supported me the whole way with cheers.. I loved it!*

However, the second thing I had up my sleeves didn‚Äôt pan out which might have been for the best. I would have had limited time in between each event so it might have made that Marathon extra hard. However, I decided to embark on my own adventure of a 4x4x40 which I then decided to complete the entire [4x4x48](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/21/xx-recap.html) (which involves running 4 miles ever 4 hours for 48 hours).

*Doing a 4x4x48 means sometimes you find yourself running at night in the snow/rain. It‚Äôs fun right?*

It was one of those fun accomplishments that I was doing for myself and no one knew but me so that made it all the more fun. Kind of like when I ran a [5k a day for 365 days](https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html) as no one really knew much about it till the end. It wasn‚Äôt that I was hiding it but it was something that I wanted to prove to myself just like the 4x4x48. I am not really sure what this year will bring as I haven‚Äôt signed up for anything but I keep plugging along. If anything I am going to keep exploring as a good thing about being able to run further from my house is I find new places to explore.

As I looking forward to this next year, I am looking forward to traveling again. We have a couple trips in the works for the summer that should be really fun. One with the RV and the other just flying somewhere. As a family we haven‚Äôt flew anywhere for such a long time. Additionally, I need to work some more on my ‚ÄúProject Shed‚Äù to get it in a better place to work before summer when the kids are at home every day.

I don‚Äôt think I did much around ‚ÄúLearning‚Äù this past year and for the life of me I am not sure what I was going to do. I guess silly as it is I learned (re-learned) how to be a longer distance runner but I don‚Äôt think that is what I was thinking. This year I am still going to focus on other aspects of **‚ÄúEmbracing‚Äù** which has been kind of an ongoing one but more around Embracing moments. I think being kind of locked up for the last two years (which it was good to be safe) has led me to not be as outgoing as I was and I know that needs to change slightly. I think there should be some easy wins here but just need to make the *time* and **commitment** to do it. Probably part putting myself out there again after all this time at home üòÅ.
