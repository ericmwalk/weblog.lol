Frustrating moment of a Monday… All of these Speedtests are connected to the same modem however, the first and last is the new device provided by our ISP and the second is what I have used for the past year and have had no issues until now. Such a big discrepancy and that device should be able to hold the same speeds 🤔… Maybe time to upgrade the whole thing 😁
