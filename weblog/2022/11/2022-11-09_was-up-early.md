Was up early again but had to wait a little longer to get out for a [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/8091647809) as the temperature was 32°F. Not that it was much warmer when I went but the sun was peaking out more during so in my mind it kept me warmer. I might not have packed appropriately for this cold run 🤷🏻‍♂️.
