As an owner of a OneWheel, I understand it is not the easiest to use and is slightly dangerous as you need to know your own limits. However, this [CPSC warning](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2023/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-to-Stop-Using-Onewheel-Self-Balancing-Electric-Skateboards-Due-to-Ejection-Hazard-At-Least-Four-Deaths-and-Multiple-Injuries-Reported) bothers me as I feel there are so many other things just as or more dangerous that maybe they should worry about.
