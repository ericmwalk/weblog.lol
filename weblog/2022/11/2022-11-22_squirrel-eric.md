Last week Wednesday my parents dropped off this new bird feeder called a suet feeder. It took a couple of days for the birds to show up and start getting interested in it and then yesterday for some reason this squirrel was all over the suet feeder. I thought it was most amusing as I figured he can’t really get too much of the food out as there is a wire cage around the whole thing. I was working inside in the morning so I from time to time would open the deck door and scare him away.

*Such a silly squirrel trying to get the food.. Good luck!*

This went on all day and into the afternoon as I was then working from the shed I grabbed my old Canon G7X to take a photo from a distance and you can see him sitting on the feeder here 🤷‍♂️.

*Keep it up squirrel but stop wasting your time.*

Later in the afternoon, I went inside to see the kids after school and as I walked up the deck and looked to my right I saw this sight below 😱😖. Oh come on, he actually opened the cage up and took the whole block of food that was in there.

*Ok you win this round squirrel, hope you enjoy the big meal.*

Looks like I am going to have to rethink this feeder before I add more food to it as they obviously outsmarted me this time 😔.
