It has been a couple of days so it was time to get out for a [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/7985064359). I figured I would just find some trails and do some exploring as I am still trying to find a hidden bridge around Braemar golf course. Didnâ€™t spend to much time looking but I think I know where to look next time.
