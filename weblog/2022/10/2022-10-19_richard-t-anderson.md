[Richard T. Anderson Conservation Area ](https://maps.apple.com/?address=18700%20Flying%20Cloud%20Dr,%20Eden%20Prairie,%20MN%20%2055347,%20United%20States&auid=4390874849108600753&ll=44.820508,-93.514895&lsp=9902&q=Richard%20T.%20Anderson%20Conservation%20Area&t=m)is  one of my favorite places to [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/7989368878) but it is all hills. My Lungs were burning a little today from a nagging cough so I didnâ€™t push it and just enjoyed the views.
