>"At least trolls actually do something" - John Oliver

Really good clip from <a href="https://twitter.com/iamjohnoliver">John Oliver</a> on his show *Last Week Tonight,* where he talks about how Patent Trolls are hindering innovation.

I would say my favorite part of the clip is where John Oliver thinks calling them “patent trolls” is insulting too trolls. “At least trolls actually do something, they control bridge access for goats and ask people fun riddles.”
