With Google Street View you can now visit Machu Picchu and walk around just as you were there in real life but from your home.  Since I have been fortunate to visit Machu Picchu two times in my life I had to check this out after finding this video published today.

Using Street View to check out the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu and it is almost just as amazing walking along looking at it on my computer as it was standing there.  Still to this day I remember walking around the site that is sitting at around 7,970 ft (2,430 meters) above sea level.

I decided to find a place on the street view map that I knew I had a photo of as it is hanging up in my house.  Here is two pictures I took back in December 2009 when I last visited there.  As you can see it was a wonderfully rainy/overcast day.  However, that didn't deter us from making the most of it and wandering around the place.

The specific place at Machu Picchu we took those photos from is called the "House of the Guardian to the Funerary Rock."   So I used the Google Street View to find that exact spot show below (you can start there by clicking <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@-13.1653357,-72.5446757,3a,75y,343.52h,76.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfMd0MjRKpJrt6ktfv5Rb_w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> as well).

As you can see the people at Google had great weather and clear blue sky's which makes for a great Street View to click around and see the ancient city.  Another interesting find is that you can actually take a walk on the entire <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Inca+Trail/@-13.172339,-72.5332164,3a,75y,357.74h,83.33t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1schOiwXlm38NmgwV36mdIMw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DchOiwXlm38NmgwV36mdIMw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D65.693771%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x0:0x0!2zMTPCsDExJzQxLjIiUyA3MsKwMzInMjYuMSJX!3b1!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xbffbe9744eae7086!6m1!1e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inca Trail to Machu Picchu</a>, which I have never done before so this was definitely interesting to see what I have missed (*add to bucket list).

Also, if you are into more history you should check out the Google Cultural Institute collection titled <a href="https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/u/0/project/wonders-of-machu-picchu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonders of Machu Picchu</a> as they teamed up with the Peruvian Ministry of Culture for the initiative.

I have so many more stories of my time in Peru that maybe I will share pieces of it at a later date.  However, now that I have scrolled through the Street Views and looking at old pictures again I think I am ready to go back and visit...
