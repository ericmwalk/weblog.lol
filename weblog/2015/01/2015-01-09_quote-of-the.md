>"You're either the **author** of your own book or a **character** is someone else's." - Christian Macy

This is one of my favorite quotes and I encourage you to watch Christian's entire Ignite Boulder presentation as the whole thing is really good.

As the first full week of 2015 is coming to a close I couldn't help but think this quote was perfect as I started a new job on Monday of this week.  I am not starting a job in the way that Christian describes it in the video, as I gave my previous employer about a month's notice and wrapped up all my outstanding tasks.  However, my new job was really me taking control of my career as the other options in front of me I wasn't as excited about.  So I decided to take that step outside of my past 6.5 year comfort zone and I found another company that I could get behind, enjoyed the people I met and hopefully I will be able to do great things for.
