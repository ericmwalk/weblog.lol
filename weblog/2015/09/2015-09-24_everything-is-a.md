# Everything is a Remix Remastered and Kickstarter

I can't believe I missed the announcement that Everything is a Remix by Kirby Ferguson was remastered and all four parts were put together in a nice single video.  I stumbled upon Everything is a Remix a couple years ago and <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2012/08/14/everything-is-a.html" target="_blank">wrote</a> about how great the work was back then.

However, besides the remastered version of his project, I was even more shocked to see that Kirby was running a Kickstarter again for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kirby/everything-is-a-remix-five-year-anniversary-celebr/" target="_blank">Five Year Anniversary of Everything is a Remix</a>.  Now, this is where it gets even better, there is a bunch of cool rewards out there and if his project makes it past $20K (at $15K at the time of writing this), he will start work on another Everything is a Remix project.

So watch the video below, and then contribute to his <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kirby/everything-is-a-remix-five-year-anniversary-celebr/" target="_blank">Kickstarter project</a> so we can get another great video on this topic.  Then browse some of his websites like <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/" target="_blank">Everything is a Remix</a> and his other project he has been working on called <a href="http://www.thisisnotaconspiracytheory.com/" target="_blank">This is Not a Conspiracy Theory</a>.  Honestly, how could you not be a fan of Kirby's work as he does amazing research and puts that together in an awesome video story that captures your attention?  Also, don't forget to follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/remixeverything" target="_blank">@remixeverything</a> so you can keep up-to-date on his current projects and anything else.

<em>PS - I just contributed to the project and pushed it over the 15K mark. Now only 5K more to go with 18 days left.</em>
