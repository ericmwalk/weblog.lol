From the title of this video you are probably thinking you have read a number of articles about how you can find fulfilling work and why would you waste you time watching one more video.  However, being someone who has worked at different companies in various roles I think this advice is more spot on than the rest.  It isn't necessary saying anything different but pointing out you aren't always going to get it right and more importantly it is going to take time to get right.
