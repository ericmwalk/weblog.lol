I am working on a couple other posts but this one I have had in my draft folder for some time and I am not sure why I never posted it.  Maybe I was waiting for the perfect day or say a day where I would have a bunch of meetings at work like today.  Either way it is still funny and I feel like I know a couple people that do these tricks in meetings (they must have read it when it first came out).  Does this remind you of anyone at your work or volunteer events?  If you do now you know their secret.
