### ðŸ“š [Golden Hour](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206180061-stuart-woods-golden-hour) - Teddy Fay, #7  - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
I have really been enjoying the Teddy Fay offshoots from the Stone Barrington Novels. I have enjoyed all 7 so far but there is a slight part of me worried that I am not sure how many more there will be. However, this one kind of ended that could make one leg end entirety but I am guessing that there will still be a door to open on these kind of tales.

### ðŸ“š [Swimming to Catalina](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156621.Swimming_to_Catalina) - Stone Barrington, #4  - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
Another good Stone Barrington Book as I have over the years enjoyed them. This one kept me thinking.

### ðŸ“š [The Bourne Identity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7869) - Jason Bourne, #1 - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
Definitely strays from the movie and itâ€™s been so long since Iâ€™ve watched a movie Iâ€™d like to see what some of the nuance differences were as the overall story differently. The book in my mind was rather long, but with that said I still wanted to hear it end so it did keep me returning even though overall from the movie had an idea what might have happened.
