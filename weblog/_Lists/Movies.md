### 🍿 [Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1079244) - ★★★★☆ 
Enjoyed the movie overall. However, it was a little tough at times as it jumped back and forth in times to get you back and caught up to the present.

### 🍿 [Flight Risk (2025)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1126166) - ★★★★☆ 
Was a good movie in the end with a couple twists in the story. I always get worried about movies that take place in a small place with not a lot of scene changes but they did well.

### 🍿 [The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/695721) - ★★★★☆
Enjoyed the movie took me a while to tie this movie into the others.  My youngest that hadn't seen the others was fine and then the others I think were struggling as well to figure out the connection as it has been a while.

### 🍿 [Luck (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/585511) - ★★★★☆
I think it was from youngest to oldest child on how much they liked it. Another good movie which I will say had some good points to take away 😉
