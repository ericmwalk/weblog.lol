### 🍿 [Instant Family (2018)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/491418) - ★★★★☆ 
With activities rained out last night we came home to find our youngest had just started this movie so we all joined in as a family. It is a good movie and I guess nice we all were around watching it.

### 🍿 [Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/661374) - ★★★★☆ 
Great movie to keep you thinking. I was gonna try to do some work while watching this movie but honestly, I had to keep my focus on it so I could try to figure out what’s next.

### 🍿 [The Gentlemen (2020)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/522627) - ★★★★☆ 
I enjoyed the overall movie and how they did the story. Just a great Guy Ritchie movie as you would expect. Not to mention a great cast of characters.

### 🍿 [Den of Thieves (2018)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/449443) - ★★ ☆ ☆ ☆ 
It was a good movie and maybe after the long day I wasn’t into this but overall nothing sticks out to me. However, I will probably watch the new one of this and see how I like it.

### 🍿 [iHostage (2025)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1371202)  - ★☆☆☆☆ 
I really can’t recommend this movie. I am one of those people once I start watching a movie I need to see it though to the end. This is one of them, I won’t even say it is the worst movie I have ever seen and in fact after it was done I realized it was based on a true story. However, it kind of leaves you hanging in the end (though I guess in the real world they didn’t know) and since it was made in a different language I am not sure why it is hard for me to watch a movie when the words they say do not match their mouth.

### 🍿 [Kraven the Hunter (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/539972) - ★★★☆☆ 
Was an entertaining movie overall not sure I fully grasped the tie in to the Spider-Man series but I am not a big comic buff. It for sure left as a cliffhanger at the end setting it up for what could be another movie at another time.

I won’t like I have been a fan of he other ones and you always worry with another movie in the series but this one didn’t disappoint in my opinion. Great cast of crew and I like how they weave in other characters.

### 🍿 [A Real Pain (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1013850) - ★★☆☆☆

### 🍿 [The Gray Man (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/725201)  - ★★★★☆
I might have been a little generous on my rating here but I thought the overall action was good and kept me wanting to see how the story ended. In fact at the end I felt like there could have been some more conclusions but maybe that is leaving it open to another one in the long future.

### 🍿 [Back in Action (2025)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/993710) - ★★★★☆

### 🍿 [Blink Twice (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/840705)  - ★★★☆☆ 
Bummer is I started this movie on one of my flights and couldn’t get back to it for a week later. However, with the 23 min left it did come back to me. Overall, it was an interesting movie that kept trying to make you figure out the what is next and that kept up all the way to the end scene. So for that I was happy.

### 🍿 [Luck (2022)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/585511) - ★★★★☆
I think it was from youngest to oldest child on how much they liked it. Another good movie which I will say had some good points to take away 😉
