### 🍿 [Blink Twice (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/840705)  - ★★★☆☆ 
Bummer is I started this movie on one of my flights and couldn’t get back to it for a week later. However, with the 23 min left it did come back to me. Overall, it was an interesting movie that kept trying to make you figure out the what is next and that kept up all the way to the end scene. So for that I was happy.

### 🍿 [Inside Out 2 (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1022789) - ★★★★☆ 
Good movie and did a great job building off Inside Out 1. We have watched it before but after a long day of State Swim today it was a good way to cap off the night.

### 🍿 [The Union (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/704239) - ★★★★☆ 
Entertaining movie to help pass the night while doing some work in a hotel room. I am not sure I had super high expectations for the movie but it was an action packed and yet funny at times movie.

### 🍿 [Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1079244) - ★★★★☆ 
Enjoyed the movie overall. However, it was a little tough at times as it jumped back and forth in times to get you back and caught up to the present.

### 🍿 [Flight Risk (2025)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1126166) - ★★★★☆ 
Was a good movie in the end with a couple twists in the story. I always get worried about movies that take place in a small place with not a lot of scene changes but they did well.

I have read the [book" src="https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/02/10/the-boys-in.html) and it is one of my favorites so it is not surprising that I like the movie too. It has been a while since I read it so I might have to put it back to the top of the list again.
