### ðŸ“º [The Night Agent (2023) - Season 2](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/129552) - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†
Season 2 was up and down but it did keep our attention. I am looking to see how they weave season 3 into this as they promised it at the end of this season finally.

### [The Night Agent (2023) - Season 1](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/129552) - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
We finished Season 1 and decided to hold off on kicking off Season 2 as the way each episode ends makes you want to keep going.

### ðŸ“º [Designated Survivor (2016)](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/67026) - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†
I really enjoyed season 1 and 2 but then season 3 was a little odd. Now I get this is the reelection season but I think they took it in too many angles. However, overall I enjoyed this season and kind of wished there was one more to show after the aftermath.

### ðŸ“º [Sugar (2024)](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/203744) - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
Really liked this show and I donâ€™t think I would have started watching it if it wasnâ€™t from the suggestion ofÂ [@canion](https://micro.blog/canion). I enjoyed how they doubled down on the story with old movies and stuff. Started it this past Sunday and finished it with all my flight/travel time.
