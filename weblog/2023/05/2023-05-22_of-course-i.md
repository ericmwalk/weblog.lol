Of course I tried to take the deer trail that followed this stream. It was fun while it lasted which was about 100M and then the deer must have went though the water but I stopped and turned around. I preferred my feet to stay dry as I still had a couple more [miles](http://www.strava.com/activities/9120770709) to go.
