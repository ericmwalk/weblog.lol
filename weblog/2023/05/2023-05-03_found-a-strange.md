Found a strange abandoned road (Cirrus Way) that didn’t say no trespassing so I figured I should give it a [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/9003439442). I am very curious why it became unused as it does take you to the Sky (well Sky Lane 😁).

After that I had a lovely time exploring and making my own trails in the woods.
