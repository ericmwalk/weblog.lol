Might have gotten darker faster than I thought while [running](https://strava.com/activities/9883462558)  tonight on some of the trails. If you put the pace aside I felt like I was working much harder than I should have been, maybe it was food, time of day or the flu shot I got either way it was far enough to call it a night.
