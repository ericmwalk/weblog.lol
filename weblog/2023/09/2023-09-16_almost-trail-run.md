Almost 100% trail [run](https://strava.com/activities/9862004614)  along the Minnesota River bottoms today.  Let’s just say that was fun exploring! My friend thought I got us lost at one point because we drifted far from the water but the trail reconnected so all was well.

*Might have been that wrong turn I was talking about as I don’t see the river*
