I would be lying if I said this [run](https://strava.com/activities/9815693765) felt great the whole time. First 2 miles we felt like we were pulling plows. After that we found a comfortable pace and I convinced my friend to take a detour on trails which added some miles and we came across a coyote who could have cared less about us. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
