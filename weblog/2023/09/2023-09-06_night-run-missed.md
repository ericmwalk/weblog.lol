ðŸŒ™ Night [run](https://strava.com/activities/9799094298)... Missed the near mountain blvd and ended up adding another mile to the loosely planned route. I am not complaining in this weather though. It was 61Â°F tonight, I went faster and longer today than yesterday and feel pretty good at the end.
