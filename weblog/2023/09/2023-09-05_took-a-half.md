Took a half day since it was the kids [first day of school](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/09/05/another-summer-is.html) today so I started this [run](https://strava.com/activities/9788883946) later than I would have wanted due to the heat outside. At least I had a couple mile section in the woods to take my mind off the sun and heat.
