This is a great little write up / story about a [Footbridge that connectss Bloomington to Richfield](https://tylervigen.com/the-mystery-of-the-bloomfield-bridge). In fact, I could see my self trying to dig into the history of such a thing as I stubble across random things on my runs and then go looking at old maps to see what the trail used to be or why it was there.
