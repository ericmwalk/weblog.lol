Wasn’t many tracks out there today after the snowfall this morning. I did try to find my way [paths](http://www.strava.com/activities/8642904441) that were more plowed at one point to avoid ice chunks under the snow. I crossed a path looking out to the conservation area and can’t wait to get back in there.
