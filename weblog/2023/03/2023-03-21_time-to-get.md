Time to get back to work so I had to force myself to get out for a [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/8752805032). While out I was reminded I am thankful that this bridge was built as I didnâ€™t like having to run on the [edge of the road](https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/07/27/really-didnt-feel.html) previously. Not that it stopped me but the bridge with a big sidewalk is nice.
