Welcome to the family Darby ”Hatrick” Walker…

Yes, this was our foster dog [Daffy](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/01/17/because-we-felt.html), who somehow, some way became another forever dog we have even though it was the busiest time to even think about adding another responsibility. At the end of the first week, the kids were in love with him and my wife and I were quite fond of him as well but couldn’t even fathom the number of activities and work ahead to try to make this work. We decided to ask for another week from Second Hand Hounds and they granted it, but as the second week went on I think we knew the answer was going to be yes as it was yet another week he was with us and we were all becoming attached. Don’t get me wrong potty training is never great and when everyone is busy it makes it that much harder. However, he seemed to catch on pretty fast as well as started sleeping through the night from 11pm-6am by the end of the first week. Seemed too perfect. So fast forward to today when our activities have now wound down, I am happy to say we still have him and glad we figured it out.

*Where the name came from you ask?* Well [Darby (Hendrickson)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darby_Hendrickson) was the first Minnesota Wild player to [score on home ice](https://history.vintagemnhockey.com/page/show/951091-xcel-energy-center) at the Excel Energy Center once the team was created in 2020. Our eldest son used to watch the History of the Minnesota Wild over and over all the time when he was younger so needless to say it has been ingrained in our heads.
