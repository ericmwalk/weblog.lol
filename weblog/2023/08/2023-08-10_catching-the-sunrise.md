Catching the sunrise over the Prairie on the [run](https://strava.com/activities/9619372034) today. I realized I havenâ€™t ventured to the trails North of my house for a while and it was a peaceful morning in the Conservation area. The only movement I saw was a herd of deer who I am sure I scared and they went jumping through the wooded area in the middle.
