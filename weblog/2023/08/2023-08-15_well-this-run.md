Well this [run](https://strava.com/activities/9656463577) had a lot of interesting hills but fun trails so was well worth it in the end. I am thankful my friend chose this route and we will have to explore some of the area more again. However, how can you beat some of the views from the top or even later the sunset. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
