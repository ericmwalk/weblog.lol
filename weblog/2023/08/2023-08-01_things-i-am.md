# Things I am Pondering ü§î

These things have been swirling around in my mind all day. Some are actual questions I am pondering and probably need to look for advice from others that have similar issues (e.g., kids backups) and then others are just random things I am thinking about today. It might be the early morning hour I woke up, got a run in and have consumed a fair amount of coffee.

- What is the best approach to backup all of my kids phone and computers (only 1 has one at this time)?
- Should I change up how I store photos and where I have my backups? I think I have about 4 places right now all in and videos are still a wild card.
- Note-taking is still a mess as to where I put what but I have downsized one by one by finally getting rid of Evernote but also increased one by starting to use Bear now as well ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- File storage, probably should shift to just one platform as I have some in Google Drive and now some in iCloud.
- I should really sign up for some sort of running race this year but leaning towards just a fun trail run.
- Is there any more consolidation I should do on my Social Media or Online presence side of things?
- Should I sell my iPad mini as I don‚Äôt know if I get enough value out of it today or what could do or use it for more?
- I need to get back to being a more morning person as I enjoy those quiet hours in the morning before everything gets crazy.
- Next time I take more than one day off I think I need to block off about 1/2 my morning on my first day back to just get back k up to speed (assuming I stepped away and didn‚Äôt keep checking email and working on break). I think that would help make the meeting later in the day or early the next more productive.
- When posting a picture to Micro.blog should I have it posted in Markdown or HTML?
- It would be nice from time to time e to tag a location in Micro.blog I feel like at one point there had been talk about that but I might be misremembering. I know there is shortcuts I can use to get a link in there but would be nice to make it more streamlined.
- Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if it was easier to use Focus modes on Apple devices? I really like the idea and try to set it up a number of times but then I am never sure I set it upright. You know what they need some preset ones based on your usage and what you check right away or ignore. Well, maybe that isn‚Äôt ideal because we are trying to create a better habit by using it.
- How did this list get so long! üò±
