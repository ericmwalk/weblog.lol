First time [running](https://strava.com/activities/9626352563) with the dog today. He might have had fun for half of it but then I think he was ready to be done. However, in this picture I do feel like he looks happy as he was trotting along.  Honestly, he didn’t look like he was working that hard but seems to be tired out even now that it is the afternoon and he has just been sleeping the day away. 🐶
