# The Seven Summits of My Neighborhood video by Brendan Leonard

Nice find in my email today that a friend Brendan Leonard has a new film out today titled [“The Seven Summits of My Neighborhood”](https://youtu.be/7SLadjqxhhc) which I found very entertaining and insightful. It reminds me that as much adventure can be found all around the world sometimes there is more than you think to explore or “create your own fun” in the area you live that is worth exploring. There are a bunch of little quotes and insights throughout this video but the one I laughed out loud and probably was just a one-off comment though resonated with me as a runner was:

>This trail is what I think you would call “Deceptively Runnable”

I have been known to run in areas that are “deceptively runnable and turn out to be more work than planned.

You can read some more about the making of the film and how he got the idea on his website [Semi-Rad](https://semi-rad.com/2023/08/new-film-the-seven-summits-of-my-neighborhood/).
