Talking with my running friend last night gave me a little extra motivation this morning and the fast I was feeling pretty good to deviate from what I was thinking. So I extended this run to add some more [miles](https://strava.com/activities/9606067827).  It still doesnâ€™t get old seeing the sun rise early with some steam off the lake.
