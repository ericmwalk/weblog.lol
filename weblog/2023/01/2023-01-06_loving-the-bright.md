Loving the bright sun reflecting off the frost of the trees today. Should have wore spikes [running](http://www.strava.com/activities/8348403540) today. Let’s just hope someone was watching my slip sliding display in a nearby cul-de-sac. Didn’t crash as I caught myself with my hands but I’m sure it was a sight.
