Nothing like ~~running~~ [shuffling](http://www.strava.com/activities/8332844729) through deep snow today as there was probably 4-5 inches already on the ground and not plowed in some places. It was fun out there though ☃️🏃🏻‍♂️

*I did not do a face plant in the snow but the last 5 blocks was straight into the wind/snow.*
