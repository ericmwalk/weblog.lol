Sometimes when [running](http://www.strava.com/activities/8409977714), I find myself purposely or unintentionally at a dead end or cul-de-sac, I am interested to see the signs they put up. This is from a cul-de-sac and I am not sure why someone would think they could drive or dump here with all the houses around 🤷🏻‍♂️
