Still tinkering with Obsidian and I got to thinking of searching for a plugin that can post to Micro.blog directy and well... Here is a [plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Plugins/microblog-publish-plugin) that does that. Even though this is my first post from it lets see how it handles a picture link as well.
