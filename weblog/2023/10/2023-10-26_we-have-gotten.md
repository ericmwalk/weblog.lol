We have gotten a lot of water the past couple of days and the marsh is showing it as the water is almost to the bottom of the boards. The [run](https://strava.com/activities/10108496266) was good but a little slick on these planks and a lot of mud. Also, got cut short thinking I was going to miss a meeting that in turn got canceled.
