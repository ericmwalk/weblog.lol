Legs still felt it from Saturday I am guessing for the first part of this [run](https://strava.com/activities/10007699598) . However, it was a really nice day and since I had the day off I went longer than expected. Also, I think I found a path in these weeds that I can make a trail another time but will need something to cover my legs.
