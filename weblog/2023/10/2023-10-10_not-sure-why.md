Not sure why but once I spot frost on the ground in the morning I know that the weather is now changing and I should probably think about turning the heaters on in the shed office. It is at 48Â°F this morning with an outside temp of 36Â°F, I am going to tell myself it will warm up naturally today. ðŸ¥¶
