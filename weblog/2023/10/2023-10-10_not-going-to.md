Not going to lie I was super excited to see this in the mail box tonight. Can’t wait to see what my friend Eliot Peper has cooked up in this book, [Foundry](https://eliotpeper.com/books/foundry)… How can it not be good when the inside cover says, “This is a story about two spies locked in a room with a gun.” 😃
