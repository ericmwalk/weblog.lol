Sometimes you have a double [run](https://strava.com/activities/10051134913) day 🤷‍♂️. Some meetings got canceled and with how busy the day was up to this point I just needed a break. So I hit the trails north of my house as I know them well enough to zone out and not trip on things. All the rain brought the water level up to the boards 😳.
