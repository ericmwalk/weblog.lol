Finding my way around Lake Ann‚Äôs trails both marked and unmarked. Only ran into a few obstacles on this [run](https://strava.com/activities/10055552373) and only almost fell once when I was in tall grass with some poorly constructed wood blocks to run on which I couldn‚Äôt see. However, sure could tell it was fall in the trees. üçÇ
