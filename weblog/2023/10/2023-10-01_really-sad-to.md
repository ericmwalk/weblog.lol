Really sad to hear that the [Twin Cities Marathon](https://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-marathon-canceled-black-flag-heat-10-mile/600308925/) got cancelled today but with the weather I get where organizers had to make that tough call. I do feel bad for the runners to as I know being on that starting line a year ago all the hard work and miles you have to put in to get to that point.
