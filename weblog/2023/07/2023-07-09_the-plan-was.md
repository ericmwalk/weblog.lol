The plan was to have a longer [run](https://strava.com/activities/9418901688) and start earlier today but I had a 5:30 wake-up from our older dog and then I willed myself to go back to sleep which then I slept longer than planned. Oh, well I at least got some miles in before a busy day of getting the house put together before company as we have not been around much.
