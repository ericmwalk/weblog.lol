You know it is going to be a warm one today when it is 75Â°F at 6am. For that reason I decided to do a short [run](https://strava.com/activities/9531028797) and early today. Also, a bonus a new [Hemispheric Views episode](https://hemisphericviews.com/) dropped to pass the time and forget about how thick the air was.
