Couldn’t agree more with this statement from [Spencer Fry](http://www.spencerfry.com/my-sabbatical) about time off

>When you’re working, it’s important to be present and engaged with work, but there’s no reason (unless there’s an emergency) to check in on things when you’re away from your desk.

I have been challenging myself over the past year when taking time off trust the team and stop checking in or getting a pulse.
