Back to familiar trails... Well I guess I have been going to Maine enough now that maybe those trails feel second nature too. Feeling sluggish today and hoped this [run](https://strava.com/activities/10343865466) would do the trick after traveling back to Minnesota early this morning. I think it worked but limited sleep is probably my problem.
