Last year was the first year for a [Christmas gift to my son](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/01/11/another-hr-drive.html) I took him to the Iowa State men's basketball game. I pulled him out of school a little early and we did a 3 hour trip down to Ames, Iowa for a 7pm game and then once it was done make the 3 hr drive home getting back around 1am.

This year he was asking for the same thing again as he had a great time and wanted to go watch another game. So around the first part of November, I looked into it and found that not only could we watch the [mens game](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/12/17/basketball-game-two.html) but the [womens game](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/12/17/basketball-game-one.html) as well. So yesterday was the day where we woke up at early to be on the road by 7am to watch a noon women's game and then a 5pm mens game. The games couldn't have turned out any better for a fan or even someone that isn't a fan as we were able to see both teams pretty handily win. My parents joined in on the fun and came to both games as well as a dinner in between both at [Hickory Park Restaurant](https://hickoryparkbbq.com). Our seats were pretty good as I didn't get them right when tickets would have come out and since the College kids are on break I was able to snag us front-row seats for the women's game and the first row in the upper deck for the men. Both seats I thought were good and for different reasons.

Luckily, the men's game only lasted around 2 hrs so we could get on the road in good time and made it back to Eden Prairie by 10:30pm. I had a great day spending time with my son as we don't always have a free day where neither of us has something going on. I guess I need to put a reminder in my calendar for when the games come out so I can be on the front end of planning for next year and what games we might go watch.
