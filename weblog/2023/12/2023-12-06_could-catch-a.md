Could catch a little bit of the sunrise on my [run](https://strava.com/activities/10337361109) this morning which was good to see as it has been overcast here all week. Today I decided to “circle” downtown and find some other areas to explore. This only meant I found a fun hill to climb that I was not as excited about finding.
