I have now twice in the last almost month been down for the count for over 24hrs. I am hoping to not make this a tradition in 2024 🤦‍♂️. Sad I missed out on all the Christmas Eve activities with my family but glad to be better somewhat today to enjoy. Thanks to my wife as always to make sure the magic continued as I was down for the count. 🎄🎅
