# Reflection

Walking my daughter out to the bus like I do almost every morning I am here reminds me of the small things that I get to take advantage of working remotely. Just the small conversations, not always happy as she doesn't like getting on the bus at 7am, but overall it is these moments I didn't have with my other kids and sometimes real conversations come out as it is just genuine and in the moment. I will miss them in a couple of years when she is older and will not want me to walk her to the bus stop anymore. So I will continue to try and cherish these days even when she is angry for me making her goto school. ðŸ¥°
