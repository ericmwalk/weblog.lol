Early morning Thanksgiving Day [run](https://strava.com/activities/10268015968) along the High Trestle Trail. I was surprised to find it concrete vs just a crushed rock or asphalt. Also, I veered off the main trail as it got lighter out as I realized there was an intact section of another track that was fun to meander on.
