Had a dentist appointment this morning which was right next to these two lakes that has a nice trail around it so I took advantage. Probably should have tried to mix some more speed in this [run](https://strava.com/activities/10217417552) but with the wind at my face this seemed like a good pace to just cruise and enjoy the beautiful day.
