Had to pickup the liner for the hockey rink today and it was by some trails I have [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/10252138815) on once before. So I decided to use my time wisely and go exploring some more of the area. As you can see it was a nice stroll on some crushed rock paths and some narrow maybe paths winding around the terrain.
