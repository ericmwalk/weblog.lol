Congratulations and a well deserved recognition for my amazing wife on not only being nominated but received the Special Caring Award from the Bloomington Public School district. We didnâ€™t know she won the award before showing up to the event last night. It was a fun event and interesting hearing the nomination stories of so many teachers (and others) that go way above and beyond to help students.
