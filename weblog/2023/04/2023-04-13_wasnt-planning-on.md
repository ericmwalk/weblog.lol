Wasn’t planning on going for a [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/8885699379) to today and took it easy since I needed to somehow get my car as it was in the shop getting the AC fixed 🤦‍♂️. I hadn’t run on this little trail in a while as they have had it closed and I am sad to see they cut out a lot of trees but I am sure they had their reasons but I liked how this trail had tons of tree coverage.
