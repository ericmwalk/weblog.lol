After a busy day of manual labor getting the campsite setup it was good to get out for a quick [run](http://www.strava.com/activities/8933089805). I decided to take the backyard trail (as I call it) and it wasnâ€™t as wet as it has been sometimes and it looks like they are making it more like a trail which I am indifferent if I like or not.
