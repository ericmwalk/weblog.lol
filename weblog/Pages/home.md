ðŸ‘‹ Well, looky here, it appears you've stumbled upon yet another weblog! 

Don't want details and want to dive right in? Scroll to the bottom to see my most recent 5 posts.

This website is kind of my place on the internet that I am thinking will be the starting point of my social interactions online. Over the years I have created and destroyed countless blogs but eventually got all of them in once place. They are still found at [ericmwalk.blog](https://ericmwalk.blog) as well just so I have a backup and right now that is where I serve my photos on this site from as I have the workflow down. 

However, this here site has been more hand crafted with the theme, look, and behind the scenes scripts that is much easier for me to tinker with so I have some more control on what is going on. This has been great as it has given me a chance to flex new skills of website tinkering.

I still have more work to do here but I like how everything has turned out since brining all my old stuff in. I still need to make some better connections behind the scenes but overall it is in good shape.
