# Day 2 Recap in Sedona...

[Devil's Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/SzXYo7WkofiganZj6) like that I am still shocked that all kids hiked the 2 miles there and 2 miles back with smiles on their faces for the most part. Also, we got to spend the day with Cousin Anna. After that we had Ice Cream, swam in the pool/hot tub, and ended the night watching the sunset.
