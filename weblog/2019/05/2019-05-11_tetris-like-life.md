# Tetris like Life


> If Tetris has taught me anything, it's that errors pile up and accomplishments disappear.

This quote has been sitting in my drafts for as long as I can remember. My day job has been kept me really busy prior to a quick family vacation earlier this week and an upcoming work trip next week. I ran across this quote again and it seemed like the perfect thing to share.

I am sure we can all relate to this quote as it seems like everyone always remembers when we missed something or made a mistake. It isn't that no one celebrates the wins and successes in our lives as well but most of the time those are short-lived and don't come around as often as we like.
