[Breach](https://www.amazon.com/Breach-Analog-Novel-Book-3-ebook/dp/B07HHY3MRM/)by Eliot Peper ([@EliotPeper](https://twitter.com/eliotpeper)) was a great ending to the Analog series as it compliments both [Bandwidth](https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/04/01/bandwidth-by-eliot.html) and [Borderless](https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/10/30/borderless-by-eliot.html). Not to jump too far to my conclusion but this is another great book by Eliot and I really enjoy how his books can stand by themselves but are also tied together to make a great series.

*I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy to read but as I really do enjoy Eliot's writing I bought the Kindle and Audiobook version too in order to add to my growing collections of great books.*

For the final story in the analog novels, Eliot further weaves the prior books of this series together by bringing back prior characters that some may have forgotten. This time, however, the people who long ago were manipulating the feed are the only ones capable of saving it as an activist group is trying to destroy the credibility and power it possesses.  

A stranger in hiding discovers that this group of powerful people wants to destroy the feed and she knows she needs to do something about it.  The stranger has been in hiding for so long trying to forget about the missteps of her past life knows that what is being discussed could hurt those that she was close to. She must decide if it is worth it to come out of hiding to help her friends that she abandoned long ago.

Prior to this Emily, who had manipulated a backdoor to the feed had no thought of going back and reconnecting with her past friends and acquaintances but after stumbling upon this plot to hurt those people she knew she couldn't sit idle.  As she weaves her way back into the lives of those she abandoned she reflects on her upbringing and what brought her to where she is today.

Honestly, I could go on and on about the story but I think you should pick up a copy yourself to read as I don't want to spoil anything that might give away how it ends.

## Attention to detail
As always, Eliot does great with the details. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy reading his books. He writes in a way that paints a vivid picture of what the character is seeing, hearing and feeling as they go about the story. All of that further adds to the story as you feel you are part of the action.

Not to mention he does a great job drawing from current events and issues in the world today to bring this story that much closer to the very near future. Topics around student loans, schools effectiveness, and of course politics on a global scale just to name a few. 

This story was tightly woven into the other two books of the Analog series by the characters, but Eliot also made sure the books could be read by themselves. Keep your eyes out for the easter eggs that he drops into the stories when he might reference other characters or places from other books he has written. I am sure I didn't catch them all but when I find something referencing a different book (not part of this series) it does put a smile on my face. 

As with almost all of Eliot's books, I really enjoy the quotes and insights that are sprinkled about. In the various types of books I read, I don't normally pull out motivation from fiction books.  However, I am thinking Eliot does this on purpose as the character is normally trying to motivate themselves or others but the same statements can be used in everyday life. One that stuck out for me in this story is below.

> Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.

## Final Thoughts
If you are looking for a good book to read while enjoying the warmer summer months I would definitely suggest picking up this book as it will keep you wanting more. Not to mention if you have not read any of the books in this series I would suggest starting from the beginning as you can't go wrong.

I really do enjoy Eliot's books and his style of writing as you can tell. I can't wait to see what is up next for him as he continues to produce great work.
