# Wordless Wednesday 06/19

![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/927ef2446e.jpg)

Trail running is always my favorite but I enjoyed the company on this Father's day [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/2455248907) even more. I might need to get her a better bike if we keep this up. (June 2019, Eden Prairie)
