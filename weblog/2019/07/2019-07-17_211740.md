Last weekend we did a bike ride around Eden Prairie to hit up 5 Little Free Libraries. We had a bunch of books to distribute but in the end, I think we came back with just as many as we started with ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Oh well, we got to enjoy time outside, gave some books, received some books, and the kids got ice cream sandwiches as a treat.
