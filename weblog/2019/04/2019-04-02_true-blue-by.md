This is a really cool idea of turning a short story into something different. It isn't really a comic book but something almost living by utilizing the technology of today to create and make the story more visually appealing. I enjoyed the story when [I read it in 2017](https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/06/23/true-blue-a.html), but the story combined with the illustrations and design make for an even more brilliant read.

I am a fan of Eliot's work as I have tried to read almost everything he has written. However, for this creation I need to be sure to give credit to the Illustrator [Phoebe Morris](http://phoebemorriscreative.com/) and the Designer, Art Director and Developer [Peter Nowell](https://pnowell.com/).

If you are curious about the creative details of the online version check out Eliot's post on Medium titled [Making 'True Blue'](https://medium.com/@eliotpeper/making-true-blue-f66a538d0ea5).
