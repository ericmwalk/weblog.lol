<p>Looking for some motivation today? I might have something for you as I too was looking for motivation.</p>

<p>Looking back through the many draft posts and odd saved internet findings. As I read through it now after not reading this quote for 3-4 years I am reminded how true it is. Simple yet true. I think back to where I was 1, 2, or even 10 years ago and most of what has made me to this point are what I have taken in from the world.</p>



>You are the books you read, the films you watch, the music you listen to, the people you meet, the dreams you have, the conversations you engage in. You are what you take from these. You are the sound of the ocean, the breath of fresh air, the brightest light and the darkest corner.</p><p>You are a collective of every experience you have had in your life. You are every single second of every single day. So drown yourself in a sea of knowledge and existence. Let the words run through your veins and let the colors fill your mind until there is nothing left to do but explode. There are no wrong answers. Inspiration is everything. Sit back, relax, and take it all in.</p><p>Now, go out and create something.</p>
