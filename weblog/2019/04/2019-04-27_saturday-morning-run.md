Saturday morning run and conversations with this girl and her favorite dog. It is kind of selfish as I want to run but I truly enjoy the company and conversations from this girl. The only problem is she wants to stop every mile or so to just listen to the birds or watch the geese, ducks, and squirrels move about. I can't really complain though who doesn't just enjoy just being outside. 🏃‍♂️🐶
