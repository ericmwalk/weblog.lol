Something is New around here... Welcome to Up North!
<br>
I am certain you have noticed that the blog has changed ever so slightly as it is no longer called <strong>Still Thinking...</strong> In all honesty, nothing about the blog specifically has changed from a content perspective I just decided after a little over 4 years I wanted a new name and maybe a fresh start at this. So I

I had alluded to this in a post I wrote about earlier this year titled "<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/03/14/posting-standstill.html">Posting Standstill</a>" where I had been thinking about this for a while and it was a crutch about not doing anything in the end. I am glad that I just pushed forward as you can see it took me 4 more months to finally complete the task of switching the domain name on the site. It is not that it takes that long to switch a site over but I continued to wrestle with it in my mind since that post but told myself to not let it hold any other posts back.

<br>
### So will anything change?

I doubt anything will really change right now as I am enjoying the current non-specific schedule. I think if anything you will see some more writing about thoughts and experiences. In addition, I am sure I will just share some shorter things that might be of interest or making me think from time to time.
<br>
I was actually looking back at some of my earlier posts on this site the other day, and one post called "<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2014/11/03/starting-from-the.html">Going back to the beginning</a>" caught my attention. There is a sentence in there that probably sums up what this blog has been and might be for eternity.
<br>
>I am blogging as a way to share interesting stories and thoughts.

### Ok, ok, I get all of that but why Up North!

I am sure at the time I was thinking about it I had a much better reason. However, it really came down to I wanted a change and something simple. I live in what some call the Bold North or that is how it was advertised during the Superbowl and it has kind of stuck around for some. Also, when I think of Up North, I think of someone spending time outside and that my friend is something I enjoy. After I <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html">refound my love of running</a> I try to get outside almost daily now as it is almost like therapy. In addition, over this past year, I have made it a priority to explore more of the parks and trails around my city as I have regretted such a thing in my past life.
<br>
Sum all of that up and the name just stuck for me as it meant something.
<br>
For those of you that have been with me for a while or if you are new here I am thankful no matter what. I hope everyone sticks around and as always leave me a comment if you have any suggestions, questions, or just want to drop me a note.
