Tripp and Tyler have nailed it again with another "In Real Life" video but this time tackling Air Travel in Real Life.  Also, I couldn't have watched this video at a better time as I just finished booking all my work travel for January and February.

If you enjoyed this video, check out their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC310aJFjr6Gn9mGZjMZ2VTQ">YouTube</a> page where you can find more funny videos.  Another video of theirs I posted a while back was titled "<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/03/04/conference-call-in.html">Conference call in Real Life</a>", which again is very spot on if you are prone to having conference calls during your week.
