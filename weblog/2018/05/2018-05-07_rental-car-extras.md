Over my life, I have traveled to quite a few different airports in the US and overseas.&nbsp; During most of my trips, I need to get a rental car in order to get to my final destination.&nbsp; I just got back from my&nbsp;last trip and this really made me think about how the&nbsp;travel industry <strong>(looking at you Airlines</strong>) is moving in this direction of buy-ups. As always, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/trippandtyler">Tripp and Tyler</a> have done it again by giving everyone a glips into how it sometimes goes down.

### My Thoughts
I have to admit as much as I enjoyed the video, I can't remember the last time I had rental car issues.&nbsp; However, since travel frequently most companies have my profile on file that allows me to walk up and grab a car and drive away. Avoiding that discussion with a sales agent trying to get me to buy more. I remember when that wasn't the case and I felt they were trying to sell me every part of the car and all I got was the shell. I just remember being confused what was really included in the quote when I ordered the car.

Airlines are in this game as well but to varying degrees&nbsp;based on the airline, you travel. It seems more airlines are going in this direction as well and it is really disappointing but a the same time I get what they are trying to do. They are trying to make people feel they are getting a great price at the time of purchase only to find out it didn't include everything. The worst part is all of these "fees" really add up for airlines and more than likely going to the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2018/02/airlines-profit-comes-when-you-pay-baggage-and-change-fees/">bottom line</a>.

It is very common these days that if you are not a regular flyer or have a credit card for the airline you are flying you&nbsp;more than likely will have to pay baggage fees. Some airlines are now going to start charging customers for full size carry on's depending on the ticket you purchase (<em>Thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/baggage/carry-on.html" rel="nofollow">United!</a></em>) Then, of course, there have been the odd one from a while back where one airline was charging people to use the bathroom. Yes, the Bathroom. I believe that didn't stick around but you can see that you need to be careful when booking travel and make sure you know what you bought.

What are your thoughts? Do you think companies should just give you one flat cost and have everything included? Or should they give you a base price and then have you pay for upgrades / additional services.
