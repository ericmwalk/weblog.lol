*I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy to read but as I really do enjoy Eliot's writing I bought the Kindle version too in order to add to my growing collections of great books.*

The story picks up where Bandwidth leaves off as groups are more aware of the true power that the feed can possess on the global civilization. The main character from the previous book, Dag, is living with Diana and he is no longer working as a lobbyist and spends his days coloring. 

This story is from Diana's viewpoint, who is working as a freelance spy now that she has left the CIA. A subtle underlying story of the book is how Diana is trying to figure out how to avoid second-guessing herself, putting trust in others, all while battling mentors and others from her past. While she is dealing with her own internal struggles, she needs to stay sharp in order to put a stop to others taking over one of the world's most important resources.

## Attention to detail
The one thing I have really enjoyed about this series is how it talks about the feed but never does Eliot really describe how the feed is connected to us or what it really is. I think it is great to leave that abstract out as we each have our own thoughts and images of what that might actually look like. Also based on how the characters in the book use/talk about the feed you continue to create in your mind what that looks like.

One of the things I appreciate about Eliot's books is the realistic characters, their struggles, and overall attention to detail. Even though the book is written in a near-future time, he used tools at his disposal to map/chart out what the world would have looked like and the paths the characters could have taken.

Also, as with all of Eliot's books there are hidden Easter Eggs for you to find where he may reference other books he has written. It always brings a smile to my face as I know it isn't always easy to tie books from different series together but a lot of authors do it.

## Final Thoughts
If you are looking for a good book to read as the colder months are approaching I would definitely pick this book up as it really grabs your attention from the first page and keeps you wanting more.

Finally, Eliot has another book in this series that is schedule to be released in May 2019 titled "[Breach](https://www.amazon.com/Breach-Analog-Novel-Eliot-Peper/dp/1542044596/)" that I for one am excited to see what is next.
