Ran across this video that <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/08/how-the-sun-seesyou/">Matt Mullenweg's </a>posted a while back.   It reminds me how important sun block is for everyone.  Would be interesting to see how spray sun block looks under the light compared to the lotion they show.  Since I have found it much easier to use for myself and our kids but I am guessing it might not cover as well/consistent.
