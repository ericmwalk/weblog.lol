This is a very long overdue post about a book I read titled “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Your-Way-Top-business-ebook/dp/B01JPOHNJC/">Sleep your way to the Top (and other myths about business success)</a>” by Jane Miller.  I was actually lucky enough to get a copy from <a href="http://fgpress.com/">FG Press</a> not long after I had <a title="Books, Books, and more Books" href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2014/06/13/books-books-and.html">written</a> about the number of books I had been listening to so far in 2014.

Honestly, when I got the email with instructions on where to get the book I had no idea what the book was about.  Since I was lucky enough to get a copy of the book, I decided to take the challenge of reading it. It was defiantly worth my time and I would encourage anyone and everyone to read this book.  It is packed with great life lessons/thoughts based on the situations, successes, and mistakes that Jane made.

It touches on various topics like resume writing, interviewing, being a team player, and when is the right time to leave a company.  At the end of each chapter, there are questions to ask yourself, that I believe are designed to make you more aware of your strengths and weaknesses.  Also, depending on where you are in your career you can use some of the questions/situations she poses to help you try to figure out what your dream job is and how that may or may not relate to your current job/role.

I wish I could have read this book when I was in college getting ready to graduate as there are some really good life lessons that everyone goes through in the world of business.  The best part is that all of those tips and lessons are embedded in a funny and captivating story.

Finishing this book was really easy, the only painful part was my lack of sleep since I couldn't put the book down as I always wanted to finish another chapter before shutting my eyes.

So if you are looking for a good book to read I would definitely encourage you to find this book and while you are at it check out <a href="https://janemiller.com//">Jane Miller's website</a> to read other things she has written.
