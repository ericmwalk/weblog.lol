# Starting from the Beginning..

In a hope to continue to jump-start my writing on this blog I decided to sign up for a Blogging 101 course through <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/">The Daily Post</a>.  I have blogged off and on for many years now but only seriously thought about putting my blog together about 3 years ago (that wasn’t for family travel/photo purposes).

For some quick details about myself check out my <a title="About" href="https://ericmwalk.blog/about/">about page</a>.

Now on to the more meaningful question about why I am blogging, what will I be blogging about.  The first question is an easy one about why/what I am blogging about since I changed how I would be using this site a couple of months back and <a title="Now that’s different" href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2014/10/13/now-thats-different.html">wrote about it</a>.  The short answer is I am blogging as a way to share interesting stories and thoughts.  The topics will probably be a range of things that I find interesting and will probably be clearer as I post more often so stay tuned.
