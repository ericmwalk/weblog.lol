I am going to publish this post about awkwardness.... and keep going.  What a great video that came from Ignite Boulder21 by Banks Benitez (<a href="https://twitter.com/BanksBenitez">@BanksBenitez</a>).

One of my favorite quotes in the video is the one he shares from Dr. Seuss and for some reason really hits home with me as it reminds me very much of my wife and I as we are both weird.

>"We're all a little weird. And life is weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutual weirdness and call it love." - Dr. Seuss
