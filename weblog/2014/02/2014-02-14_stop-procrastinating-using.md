# Stop Procrastinating...!!!! Using the 'Seinfeld Strategy'

If it's a deadline, email, phone call, blogging, or working out everyone has something they procrastinate about and always say, "I wish I could do better." &nbsp;So,&nbsp;what is the "Seinfeld Strategy" and how does it work you are probably wondering. &nbsp;The advice that Jerry Seinfeld gave to Brad Issac (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret"><em>LifeHacker</em></a>), who wanted to be a better comic, was simple, "Write everyday and don't break the chain."

More specifically this is what Seinfeld told him to do:

"Get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. Then get a big red magic marker. For each day that you complete your task of writing, put a big red X over that day.

Then after a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. &nbsp;You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain."

I actually read an article published by <a href="https://twitter.com/james_clear">James Clear</a><span style="line-height:1.5;"> from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/success-and-motivation_b_3624606.html"> The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/success-and-motivation_b_3624606.html"> Huffington Post</a></em> six months ago which referenced the same story and had his own take on the matter. I remember telling myself I needed to get back to writing as it has been an area I would like to improve on in my older/wiser years. Well, fast forward six months and I saw the same article written again by James Clear but for <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231023">Entrepreneur</a>.

That reminded me that I had this blog post started from back then and I never did complete it or follow the advice at that time.

However, this time when I read the article I was reflecting on how I have been using the "Seinfeld Strategy" by writing more and more each week (I finally started in January). &nbsp;Not everything I write gets the publish button pushed, but nevertheless there is writing being done so that I <em>"<strong>don't break the chain</strong>."</em>
