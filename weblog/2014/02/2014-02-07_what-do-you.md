>"If you don't know where you want to go it doesn't matter what path you take, just enjoy the ride and your resume will probably build itself"

It is just one of those days that I was reminded of an <a href="https://twitter.com/igniteboulder">@IgniteBoulder</a> video I saw last summer by Casey Hopkins (<a href="http://twitter.com/caseyhopkins" target="_blank" rel="user">@caseyhopkins</a>) who talked about how to "Build Your Geek Resume."

>"With all of these hobbies granting real world skill, who knows what the future has in store.  All we know is that there will always be more hobbies to inspire the future generation of resumes."

I felt like she made a great correlation between how hobbies assisted with gaining real world knowledge.  If you ever want to create something new or be an entrepreneur start with what you know, the best way to do it is to find something you have a passion for.

Take the 5 min and watch her presentation and if you are a "Geek" it will defiantly be worth it.  If you aren't, well it will still be a good listen for 5 min.
