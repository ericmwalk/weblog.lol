# Plan vs Reality

![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/b1447daa75.png)

Ran across this picture today and found it to be fitting with how most Plans and Planning goes compared to what the reality.  However, that doesn't mean that you should forget about planning because you just want to roll with the punches.  In fact the picture above should remind you of the opposite.

>"If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!"  - Benjamin Franklin

Remind yourself that a plan is never set in stone and problems/issues will most likely present themselves during the execution process.  When unforeseen issues arise you should use that time to reevaluate the current plan/outcome and make modifications as necessary.  How you handle those issues will prove to be the ultimate success or failure of the outcome.  You might find that what you thought you wanted as an outcome is not the best anymore and you will be glad you reevaluated it during the process.
