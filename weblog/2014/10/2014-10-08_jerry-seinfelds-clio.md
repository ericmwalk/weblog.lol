What a great acceptance speech by Jerry Seinfeld's at the 55th annual CLIO Awards.  Really funny stuff.

>I love advertising because I love lying. In advertising, everything is the way you wish it was. I don’t care that it won’t be like that when I actually get the product being advertised, because in between seeing the commercial and owning the thing, I’m happy. And that’s all I want.
