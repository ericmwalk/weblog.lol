I just ran across this article published by CNN Money titled "<a href="http://fortune.com/2011/04/05/the-most-ridiculous-job-interview-questions/?emc=lm">The most ridiculous job interview questions</a>".  All I will say is I am sure the interviewee gets a good kick out of the answers for some of these questions.  However, in reading through them here are a few of my favorite brain teasers, can you figure them out?

The boxes have been incorrectly labeled so that no label accurately identifies the contents of any of the boxes. Opening just one box, and without looking inside, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?" -- Apple
