I have realized today that it has been hard to focus on work lately as my mind has been searching else where.  However, in some emails that I received from a non-profit that I assist with outside of work I realized what developers sometime miss.  Not to make this generalized but in my experience some developers forget about the overall goal.  For instance this non-for-profit, their main goal was to spice up their website which I really think is a good idea.  However, if you asked me the second point needed to be stressed that it was easy to use.  So instead we have a nice product that is not as user friendly in the back end and I have been troubleshooting something I didn't create.  Not that I am unable to assist it is just not my day job.

Well didn't mean to group all developers into that group, since I realize I have developed things.  However, I have ran into this experience a few times so thought I would share.
