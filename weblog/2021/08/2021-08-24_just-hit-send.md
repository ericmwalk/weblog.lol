# Just hit send üì®

Honestly, I am not very good at keeping in touch with people. This could really be anyone, friends, old co-workers, newer acquaintances. For some reason, I always have great intentions of reaching out but just never feel it is the right time to reach out and say I will later.

I was reminded of this the other day while running and I passed an old co-worker and friend of mine walking with his wife. I said hi quick but since I was running with another guy I didn't stop to talk. After I got done I was reminded that I have been meaning to reach out to this guy for a long time and every time I would think about it I would find about 100x other things to accomplish. Don't get me wrong it has nothing to do with the other guy because I do this all of the time. It is just one of those tasks that always get buried for me thinking I will find a better time to reach out or I will do it right after work.

I guess you could say it is a good thing I am aware of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. However, I am going to try to be better and see about setting time aside for starters each week to reconnect with some people whom I haven't but have been meaning to for a while. We all get busy from time to time and with kids thrown into the mix it gets even worse. However, there is always time to keep connections flowing instead of dead ends.
