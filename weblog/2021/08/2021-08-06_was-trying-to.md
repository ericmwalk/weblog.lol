Was trying to find quote I was pretty sure I put in a note app at one point and realized I have a lot of note taking type apps. I really would like to get it down to **one** but some are better for just text but I like snapping photos to save in notes too.

As much as I donâ€™t want another one does anyone have any suggestions for short style notes / photo notes?
