Pretty sure I was chased by the same bird that followed me a couple of weeks [back](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/06/18/i-was-followed.html). This time however it was less in a fun way of circling me and more of an attacking / intimidating me. I am guessing the bird has a nest that is close to this boardwalk path since it seemed quite upset with me after I ran by a specific bush that is really close to the path. I remember seeing it flying by me and then instantly circled and flew after me chirping along the way. I looked back probably 3 different times and it was no more than 5 feet from me in the air acting like it would like to peck me in the head. After I finally got away and realized it wasn't following me I snapped this picture.

I am starting to think I might have to avoid this route for a while or at least not attempt it in the morning hours 🤣.
