This little issue sucked away a good chunk of time for me yesterday when all of a sudden the lights where I work shut off. Problem was some power was still flowing through to the tracks and even to the light fixtures but when I put a bulb in the fixtures nothing and the. I realized power would drop on other open light fixtures. That is when what I was hoping was a quick fix turned into a longer project as I had to take the whole track lighting down to get to the main wiring. That is when I found this gem 🤦‍♂️

Yep, older wiring in houses are an adventure indeed.

Luckily, I have tackled something like this before as I have replaced out fixtures and outlets so I had all the supplies I needed to hopefully not have it happen again. All fixed now and track lighting is working perfectly again. 💡👨‍🔧
