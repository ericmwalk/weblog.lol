Chanhassen really likes these [signs](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/03/03/took-a-couple.html). Why can’t they make mention of it at the beginning of the trail instead of after you fully committed to a half mile in. Then the only options are up a hill through someone’s private yard or back the way you came. I took the hill 😁. 🏃🏻‍♂️
