Brecken has been begging us to go family bowling since he has started in this junior League every that plays every Saturday. With his new ball finally ready it seemed like the right time for a Sunday morning family fun. Can‚Äôt beat the prices at Tuttles for $2.50 per game so we got there early and had a late breakfast while we bowled for a couple hours. Everyone seemed to enjoy doing something different but I think the third game might have been a little too much. With our family of 5 it took us about 1 hr to bowl a game but everyone powered through even with some touch and go moments at some times üòÅ.
