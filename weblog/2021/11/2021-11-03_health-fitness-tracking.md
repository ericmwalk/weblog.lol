Back when I was a long time Fitbit user, I used to have a scale from them as well so all of my fitness information was in once place. In fact, from time to time I would keep track of foods I ate in the Fitbit app as well and it worked pretty well overall.

However, as time has passed I got [frustrated with Fitbit](https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/10/08/goodbye-fitbit.html) and itâ€™s lack of durability from my point of view and move to a Garmin. I still used my Fitbit scale until it broke not long after but also my wife had bought one of those [Shapa scales](myshapa.com) that was about the worst type of scale out there. Sorry, I am sure it works for some people but for me I could care less what color I had I just wanted to know my actual weight in lbs ðŸ˜†. I did figure out how I could get a number by having the information shared with Google Fit and then I could just manually put it into my Garmin Connect app. I hate to say I did that for longer than I would like to have admitted before I got tired of doing the manual part and just donated the scale as no one else was using the piece of garbage anyways.

That brings me to today as I would like to keep track of my weight again as well as try to track my calorie intake. I am trying to figure out the best route to take here and am open to suggestions. Ideally, I would like a single app that could pull all of this information together as a one stop shop. I know I could buy a normal scale and enter the information manually but for me I want to set a routine of standing on the scale and not make notes to myself to record it in a system. I just want it to be automatic! Kind of like the Fitbit did for me before but since I donâ€™t have a Fitbit watch that seems kind of silly for that and I have found nothing plays super nice with Garmin Connect. Ideally, it would be something that can send data to or pull information from Garmin Connect or Apple Health.

_Any suggestions send them my way please!_
