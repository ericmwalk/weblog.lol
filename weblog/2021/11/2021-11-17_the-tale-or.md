Decided to follow a [trail](https://www.strava.com/activities/6267437384) with 6 tunnels yesterday along the 3.4 mile [Bluff Creek Local Trail](https://onthegomap.com/s/t0pshhke) in Chanhassen üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

W 78th St Tunnel _(the start of the trail)_

Arboretum Blvd Tunnel _(It is really two tunnels as you can see the space in the center but really only one road so I am counting it as one)_

Then I actually found the end of the trail so I turned around and ran back to my car üòÅ. I had actually never run on this trail before so even though the map said it was going to end sometimes things aren‚Äôt updated that well and I was thinking it might have gone further. So it did surprise me when I came to the end and the path did not go further or connect up to anything else. I am guessing it is because if they wanted to keep extending it South they would have to figure out how to go over or under HWY-212.

Overall, it was really nice trail that was all asphalt so I might have to remember this one for next summer with the kids as the distance isn‚Äôt to crazy either.

_**Update**: Since I didn‚Äôt post this yesterday as planned, I dug into some of the old Chanhassen park records and it seems like the Master Park / Trail plans from 2017 and 2018 assumed they would continue it further South. I wonder if once the construction of HWY-212 was completed they just abandoned the original plan or maybe didn‚Äôt leave a passage to get under it. I did notice that the HWY was on the original plans but based on what I know it wouldn‚Äôt have been completed at that time and was still a work in progress. Additionally, the details of their plan never really addressed how it was going to get past that HWY like other referenced markings on the plan to show an existing bridge or tunnel._
