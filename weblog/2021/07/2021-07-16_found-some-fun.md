Found some fun trails to explore today at [Theodore Wirth Regional Park](https://maps.apple.com/?q=Theodore%20Wirth%20Regional%20Park%0A1339%20Theodore%20Wirth%20Pkwy%0AGolden%20Valley%20MN%2055422%0AUnited%20States&ll=44.982258,-93.326381). Granted some where mountain biking trails but good for a runner too üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
