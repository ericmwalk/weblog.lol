Meet Stella... I found her out on my [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/5133407222) today and nowhere near my house. Between myself and another lady, that saw her at the same time while driving by, we were able to reunite this pup with her family. Added a half-mile of walking for me while carrying the pup until I could continue my run and in the end made me getting home later than planned... but well worth it. 🏃🐶

After returning Stella, I still managed to finish the run as planned with some great views and a fun little trail.
