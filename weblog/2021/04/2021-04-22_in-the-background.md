I often take pictures while out running as a way to document random things I see or things of interest. However, today's picture was entirely random to the spot but felt it gave a good view of the trail and beautiful day we were having here in Minnesota. It doesn't take me long to take a quick picture and put my phone away but to my surprise as I kept [running](https://www.strava.com/activities/5173882019) there were some deer watching me. In fact, looking back at my photo now I can spot one but I didnt see it tell after I started up again.  Makes me wonder in other pictures I have taken if I would look closer I would find something interesting üòÅ.
