Did some exploring yesterday on a long run from the [Lowry Nature Center](https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/lowry-nature-center) to the [Lake Minnetonka LRT Regional Trail](https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/lake-minnetonka-lrt-regional-trail) in order to connect up with our last week's run. Now there is only one section left on this that Trail I am missing to connect it to Hopkins 😁🏃
