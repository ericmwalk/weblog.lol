Today was aÂ  [run](https://strava.app.link/jvoRnspZxLb) in search of trails to run on and I think I chose a good trail to go ramble on this morning. Felt good enough to complete this run but probably could have been better if I would have gotten better sleep last night. Though glad to get this done as I think we are going to have a real warm one today.
