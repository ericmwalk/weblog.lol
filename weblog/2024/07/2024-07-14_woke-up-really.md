Woke up really early to get the swimmer off to swim in the first car. Then I sat in the camper debating if this [run]([https://strava.com/activities/11886117473](https://strava.com/activities/11886117473)) was going to happen. I probably missed a cooler time to complete it but I did end up adding a little bit to check out this old “camp” nearby.
