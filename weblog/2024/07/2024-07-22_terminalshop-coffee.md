Thanks to [Jamie](https://www.thingelstad.com/2024/07/20/shopping-via-terminal.html) and I guess ultimately his cousing [Qunn](https://quinnchrest.com/2024/07/19/terminal-task-tracking.html) as I saw both of the posts at the same time for me Saturday morning about Terminal Shop. As a sucker for always being up to try new coffee, I was sold. My first experience from my iPad that Saturday I couldn't get all the way through and complete my order but still what a cool way to order though you Terminal.

Want to give it a go as well with some unknown coffee just type 'ssh terminal.shop' in your terminal.

*Fast forward to Monday I did order some from my computer so I will look forward to receiving the package.. Or I think I will at some point.*
