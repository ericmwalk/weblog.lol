I love that this lake really has a [trail](https://www.strava.com/activities/12002397439) all the way around it. A good distance of ~4.3 miles the only real unfortunate part is if you are trying to avoid sun you almost canâ€™t but it is ok I will take the sun to enjoy the view. I guess to nitpick more, a round mile number would be nice.
