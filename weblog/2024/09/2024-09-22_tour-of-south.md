Tour of South Portland today where I [ran](https://strava.com/activities/12479596423) around three Lighthouses (running on the break wall was interesting to say the least). To add more fun to it on my way to get to the first one I ran through Hobstone and Robinson Woods where my ankles got destroyed from the tree roots and rocks.
