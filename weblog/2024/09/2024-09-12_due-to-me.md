Due to me not wanting to cross traffic and at the lights I decided to just create a [route](https://strava.com/activities/12393371982) on the fly which took me to a place I was 2 years ago in hopes an actual “trail” was there now. No change but just look how the trees are planted… I think they should do something here it would be amazing!
