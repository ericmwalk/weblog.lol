I thought the weather was going to be nice and cool with the overcast sky and breeze. Not to mention I was in need of some coffee so did a coffee [run]([https://strava.com/activities/12334907312](https://strava.com/activities/12334907312)) which was good but warmer than I anticipated. Well the coffee was good and helpful for work today. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
