Well that was a warm [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/12369386259) today after yesterdays pleasant morning. I really wasn't looking at my watch for time or anything and kept trying to slow down as I really wanted a nice recovery run. However, maybe the heat kept me at a faster clip than I was thinking as I just wanted to get done.
