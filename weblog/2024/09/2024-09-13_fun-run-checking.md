Fun [run](https://strava.com/activities/12403683527) checking out the new hiking trails around Braemar. Not going to lie I liked the old ones better but I am sure over time these might grow on me. However, now they have mowed at least a path connecting the East and West where I normally had to blaze my own trail to the abandoned bridge.
