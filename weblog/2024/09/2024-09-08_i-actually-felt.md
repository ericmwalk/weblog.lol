I actually felt today like I could have gone longer but no sense in overdoing it. I had hoped for this millage on my [run](https://strava.com/activities/12359680975) today but I really didnâ€™t think it would happen. Normally 15 miles is like my nemesis and some sort of disaster happens but this was a completely different experience today.
