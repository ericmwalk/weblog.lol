A month ago, the title was officially signed over, and a cashier's check was placed in my hand for the sale of what was once our camper, golf cart, and, in theory, our seasonal spot at Kieslerâ€™s in Waseca, MN. Itâ€™s been two years since we traded in our [RV](https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/09/28/goodbye-rv.html) for a larger camper at that same location. But now, as the time came to move on from that chapter, weâ€™re also moving on from the entire campsite. This transition seemed to affect our youngest the mostâ€”not because of the camper itself but more because she had really embraced everything the campsite had to offer and loved being there. With the kids growing up, and our older two preferring to spend more time with friends back home during the summer, the weekends at the campsite were naturally winding down.

Fortunately, we were able to enjoy one final day with our youngest as we packed up the last of our belongings. It was truly a fun 24 hours, where we didnâ€™t just do the usual things but also embraced the novelty of not having all our regular items in the camperâ€”most of which we had cleaned out the weekend before.

On Friday night, we biked to dinner, which turned out to be its own little adventure since the first place we tried was closed. We eventually landed at the Boathouse, sitting outside on the porch, where we spotted a bald eagle and a rainbow while waiting for our food.

Then obviously even with the little rain that fell on us on the way back to the camper after diner we had to make one last fire in the fire pit!

The next morning, with no food left in the camper, we picked up some waffles on a stick from the camp store and enjoyed them by the water.

April was unable to make the treck the night before with having to work a whole day at school but she came and joined us for a half of day Saturday morning. So we made one last trip through the trails at the nearby Maplewood park, soaking in the final moments of our time there.

It has been a great couple of years at Kieslers and having a more permament campsite to go retreat to during the summer but onto the next chapter. I am sure we will go back as "weekenders" but I double we will take up permanent residence again.
