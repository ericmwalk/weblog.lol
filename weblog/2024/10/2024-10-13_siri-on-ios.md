# Siri on iOS 18.1 I finally Fixed my Issue

Since the update that happend this last week my Siri has failed to work and I could not figure out why for the longest time. I should preface that I have Apple Intelligence running as well. Everytime I would try to ask it to do something it would quick flash and go away.

As it frustrating has not worked all week I have realized how many times I ask it to do simple things like text, open apps and what not. As I thought about it when I saw this message and captured it I got the feeling this probably was the culprit.

Using that as my guide I did some digging on the interwebs as I had some time during the swim meet this morning. Thankfully I found some help on the [Apple Developer forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/764149) as it seems like others have had a similar problem. This last comment I did exactly this and it worked.

> You should change region to something else then change again to US even if you are not in us because AI is now only working in US region after changing restart your phone then go to AI settings you should either see join the waiting list if you havent press it but if you see it says downloading, do this quick it need a quick manouver. Go to language below again and set it to English.
