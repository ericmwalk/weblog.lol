# 2024 Trout Brook 10 Miler Trail Run

Such a fun event and another [Trout Brook 10 Mile](https://strava.com/activities/12637582207)  run in the [books](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/10/07/trout-brook-ten.html) at Willow River State Park in Wisconsin. Couldn’t have had better weather as not as cool as last year but just perfect short and short weather. Glad it was cooler as I took my water bottles along thinking I would take one just incase on the run only to find out I forgot the belt it goes with. Since I didn’t want to carry it I decided to just wing it as that was what this whole tail run was anyways.

I ended up running it faster than last year though I think this route was more challenging. With more up and downs on single track trails. Which comes to find out I am not good at in a race.  Hence in the first two miles I took a little fall in order to take a souvenir home after the run on my knees. Even despite the fall and hills I probably could (should) have pushed it harder on some up hills to stick to the two leaders as after the stairs and the turn around I never saw them again and was really by myself till the end of the race to take [3rd overall](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=111355).

It was also great that I did talked an old work friend the one and only Joey Metzger to join last min this week. So it was great catching up with him before.

*I guess I could still not stop and take pictures in a race. That might help as well but.. it was just so nice out which also could be why I fell as I was not watching my feet and looking around.*
