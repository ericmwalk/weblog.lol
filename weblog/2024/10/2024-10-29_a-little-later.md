A little later start because my youngest missed the bus. So maybe this [run](https://strava.com/activities/12777341805) could have been longer in my ramblings of the streets and trails but honestly my legs were feeling it and I was feeling it. The hour before I thought I felt great but it just went down hill. I guess Sunday caught up to me.
