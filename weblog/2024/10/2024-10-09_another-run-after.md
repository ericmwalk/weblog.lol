Another [run](https://strava.com/activities/12618012740) after eating... Still not ideal but I have found out my “backyard” trail seems to have become a real trail these days as the city has made it less an [adventure/deer](https://ericmwalk.blog/2024/04/19/backyard-neighborhood-trails.html) trail and more a real trail.
