18 years and counting! It’s hard to believe how time flies, and true to form, we’re spending the evening running kids to their activities. We’ll hold off and celebrate when things calm down later this week, but for now, Happy Anniversary! So grateful to have my amazing wife by my side to navigate through it all.
