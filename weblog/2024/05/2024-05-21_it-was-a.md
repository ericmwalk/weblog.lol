It was a treadmill run today due to the rain... ðŸ˜‘

Made the most of it and got some elevation so flipped it at a 1/2 mile of 1 elevation and then a 1/2 mile at 7. Also, I somehow was not paying attention and stopped short of 6 miles at 5.99 miles. ðŸ˜±

*This will haunt me for the rest of my life.*
