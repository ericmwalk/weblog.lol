Wrong turns, hills and mosquitoes was the theme of this [run](https://strava.com/activities/11537102418). Legs felt the ski hills today and of course that was around the time I could find the trail I needed.Â  It was good to change things up today to a different location. Halfway through the run I stopped listening to the Timberwolves game ðŸ¥¹.
