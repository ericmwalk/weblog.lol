For the past couple of posts I have made, everything has been written in Obsidian and then pushed to Micro.blog via [Micro.Publish](https://micropublish.blog/) created by Otavio Cordeiro.

Not only have I used Obsidian to create and post those, they have mostly been done on my iPhone as well. I have also found that using Jarrod Blundy's wonderful iOS shortcut called [Multimedia Uploader](https://heydingus.net/shortcuts/microblog-multimedia-uploader) to get pictures on my site is the perfect addition. I can then copy that link and put it in my Obsidian document, so I can finish any extra writing as necessary prior to hitting publish.

This new process has been working well, and I not only have been doing it for my longer posts as part of WeblogPoMo2024 but also on some of my shorter posts about runs and other random thoughts that would not come through my Status.lol.

Not sure if I will continue with this for the long haul, but right now, this has also renewed my want to use Obsidian as I can use it on my various devices. A great example is this specific post: I started it on MacOS, but I am finishing it up on the plane on my iPhone prior to takeoff.
