Something I didn't do when I decided to run a [5k a day](https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html) was talk about or even mention it. Thinking back I believe I told only one person over coffee one morning. ðŸ˜‰

>*Taking a step back, my goal was at first a week, then a month, then a couple of months but I never was thinking 1 year being the goal.*

However, it was never a goal when I started so maybe that is why I didn't but I know at some point I got it stuck in my brain and I could have talked about it.

So 100 days of what, well 100 days of not having a drink of an alcoholic beverage. I should be clear on the why this is interesting and I am talking about it. Honestly, it is nothing special or big grand reason as to why, I just told myself I am going to give it a try and that is what I am doing. I have been building up some millage running and I guess part of me wanted to see if it would change how I felt or recovered during the week or after long runs. So 100+ days this is my current take aways both from a good or just interesting perspective from my own personal experience (in no order):

- I noticed about 1 month into this I was very tired and exhausted, I don't know if it attributed to this but I had a stretch that I was just tired for a good week or so straight almost like my body didn't know what to do without. I won't say I was addicted but I do wonder if like taking a week off of coffee (caffeine) sometimes you can get headaches.
- I think from my fitness perspective it has made my longer runs 100% easier and possibly a faster recovery after the fact.
- I have dropped 10 lbs from where I was hovering in all of 2023. Some of this I have changed some eating habits but I do wonder if that habit has been easier by not having some extra endless calories from time to time.

I guess I didn't really touch on has it been hard ever, the answer to this is yes in fact. As I made the decision to just step away for a little while I was very cognizant that I had a week of business travel where we were with our consultants and had many dinners out. I don't mind not having a drink but sometimes I think if the server came to me first as I was a more seniored person at the table most of the time I set the tone of not getting a drink and then everyone else followed. There was also a parent Hockey party that I feel like 100% of the time involves drinking so I did get a handful of questions as to *why* I wasn't drinking anything. No one really cares but it is something to note that people do notice and you 1000% will get a question. This also was noticed but not really asked as we celebrated my birthday a while back and went out to eat with my parents. Finally, I have noticed as time as gone on and further reflection, I have kind of avoid the easy pitfall places like hockey "safety meetings" or catching up with someone after work for a drink. Both of those places I know I do not have to drink so it isnâ€™t that at all. I think some of with this current habit change and seeing it though for a while it was easier to avoid them. I need to get this part out of my head though as I still need to be social with friends and colleagues if this experiment continues.

So that is all I have for now and as I sit over 100 days I am not going to say I might stop today or continue for another 5, 50, or 100 days. Just a reflection point for myself as it has been an interesting experiment.

*This post has been sitting in my drafts since day 50 but it is well past that at this point. I think there is two reasons here: (1) I wrote it and was going to post it right away but got distracted and never really came back to it (2) I still was for some reason not sure about posting it out as I didn't and still don't have what that end goal is or if there is a reason to this experiment.*
