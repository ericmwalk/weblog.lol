Changed it up this time and decided to have dinner at [Luke's Lobster](https://maps.apple.com/?q=Luke's%20Lobster%0A60%20Portland%20Pier%0APortland%20ME%2004101%0AUnited%20States&ll=43.654995,-70.249608). I am not sure why I donâ€™t come to this place more often good food and a nice view. Helps the weather is amazing out right now.
