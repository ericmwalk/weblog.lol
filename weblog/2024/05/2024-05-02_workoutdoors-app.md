# WorkOutDoors App

I really do like my [Apple Ultra](https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/09/23/might-be-time.html) watch and am glad to only be rocking one watch on a daily basis unlike a couple years ago. However, having the Ultra well over a year now and knowing the Apple Watch itself has been out so long I still can't believe that the missed opportunity to have a route mapping function on the watch with in the stock Workout app. Typically I don't need it often but when I map out some really long runs on my phone I have to pull it out from time to time to make sure I catch the right trail or street, two things I don't love doing when I am out running and also further makes me not want to run with out my phone.

Now, yes there are a couple apps out there that can allow you to get turn by turn directions but most are not great or require an additional subscription to use and I had found a hadful of them don't work that great or are complex to setup. Also, you run into the issue of are you going to run just that or the Workout app as well and how do you flip back and forth.

With all of that said and even with some of the limitations that are still there I was pointed in the direction of [WorkOutDoors](http://www.workoutdoors.net/) app from [Mat Routley](https://micro.blog/mroutley) which I have actually found to be a solid running map navigator. I have used it a handful of times now and been running the workout app at the same time but in the background. Flipping between them if I need to for any reason is a pain but I am getting used to it. However, my last longer run I started the Workoutdoor app then started my workout app and then went back to the workoutdoor app until about a mile or so left because I knew the direction. It didn't kill my battery for being out there for 2 hrs and 45 min of two GPS apps running and timing.

I had to buy this app but honestly I have no issues paying for an app that does what it says and it woeked better than others that wanted more of a subscription base. I will say this app has a lot of settings but I think that is what I like about this, check the settings you want on your phone, load the GPX map you want to follow or map it in the iOS app and go. Nothing to crazy just filling the gap that the WatchOS left in the Workout app. Maybe someday that will be corrected but for now I don't mid this setup and again it allows me on longer or more complex runs to leave my Garmin again at home.
