Flooding Complete: 27 hrs and 11,649 Gallons (44,096 L) of water later I am now going to call it good. It really did take much longer than when I did it in [2022](https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/12/07/flooding-complete-a.html) but I used less water overall and the rink size of 54' x 32' is the same. Now we will wait for ice to start being made by the assistance of mother nature. ðŸ§Š
