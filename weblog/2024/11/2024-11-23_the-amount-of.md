The amount of signs telling me this was not the way I should [run](https://strava.com/activities/12968308720) convinced me to turn around as I didnâ€™t want to risk injury or death as the sign said. The bridges from peoples property to the park look pretty cool though.

![Signs lie on a forest floor covered in dry leaves, warning "Posted: Private Property" and "Beware of Dogs." Bare trees and a small stream create a wooded backdrop.](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2024/img-0928.jpeg)
