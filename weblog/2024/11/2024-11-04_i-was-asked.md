I was asked if I could go pickup another new “I Voted” sticker as my wife lost the one she has when we voted early. I figured it seemed like a good excuse to get a [run](https://strava.com/activities/12823843968) in and complete a task so that is what I did and the nice lady there gave me 4 stickers.
