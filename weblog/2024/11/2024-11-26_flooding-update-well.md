Flooding Update: Well 14hr in now and all braces around the rink are in tack except maybe some small ones as things progress. However, water has still not touched the far back corner. The 18 hrs estimate from other years might be close. Not an idea time though so I am wondering if I go for another 2 hrs with 2 hoses and then cut back to 1 overnight so I can sleep with no worries. ðŸ¤”
