Flooding Update: Decided to call it a night after the 16 hr check-in as it didn't look like I was going to have any issues with it overflowing and the structure was solid. However, I was awakened at the 20 hr check-in, so I went out and did a lap again, thinking I might shut off a hose, and it still had not covered all four corners yet, so I will let it continue. Interestingly, there is a little ice forming already out there.
