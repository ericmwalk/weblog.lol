This was not sure the plan in more ways than one today. What started as me wondering what my friend was going to do for his birthday “[run]([https://strava.com/activities/12908354473](https://strava.com/activities/12908354473))” turned into me finding us a route along the Minnesota River we had not done and instead of doing the 6 miles planned it turned out to be 10. Great Morning!
