Nice and sunny out today for this [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/10654621338). I think adding so much millage last week might have made me felt more tired today than I should have.

If you look closely at this photo you can see there is a good chance that someone is going to lose a pond hockey goal if this warm weather keeps up.
