Finally got an earlier morning [run](https://strava.com/activities/10633222461) in today as the kids didnâ€™t have school. However, with the fog / mist again no sunrise views. I tried to keep this one with my heart rate low. I have never done this before but it is much harder than it seems and I checked my watch constantly.
