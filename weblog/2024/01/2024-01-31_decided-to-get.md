Decided to get an early [run](https://strava.com/activities/10667166739) in today in order to make sure I had time for it. Very quiet out which made for a nice morning. If only it was that time of year when I could have watched the sunrise. Also, not sure why I decided on a new route that of course I took a wrong turn and added some millage.
