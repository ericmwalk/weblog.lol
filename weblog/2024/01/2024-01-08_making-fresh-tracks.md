Making fresh tracks while the snow was falling today on my [run](https://strava.com/activities/10518886548). Donâ€™t get me wrong when I was on the sidewalks I was a little nervous about slipping but I didnâ€™t slip or fall only scare was a dog that lunged at me on his leash and snagged my running pants. ðŸ™„
