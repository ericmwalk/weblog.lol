Amazing how much better 30Â°F weather is to [run](https://strava.com/activities/10610753258) in after all the single or below zero temps we had last week. I wish I could have gotten out in the afternoon vs the evening as we had sleet about 30 min before I went out and a couple places were getting slick.
