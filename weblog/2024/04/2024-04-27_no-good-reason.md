No good reason but thought it was  good idea to utilize my 2 hr and 45 min wisely. All went well on this [run ](https://strava.com/activities/11277627906)until around mile 12 I realized this is where my quickly tossed together route had lots of hills for the rest of the miles. Well the boardwalk was fun and I didn‚Äôt get rained onü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
