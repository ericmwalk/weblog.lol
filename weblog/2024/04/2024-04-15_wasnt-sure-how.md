Wasn’t sure how this [run](https://strava.com/activities/11189527537) was going to go after the weekend but I felt really good. I need to do better at pivoting my route so when I want to do a little speed I don’t have the climbs. Sad to see all these areas get chopped out but I guess the invasive species need to get removed sometime.
