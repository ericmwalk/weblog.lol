Well I was thinking about having a longer run today not knowing what the weekend is going to hold but my running friend I was able to twist his arm for Sunday. Glad I scratched that after two blocked I to this [run](https://strava.com/activities/11271186010) as it poured for about the first 1.5 miles. 🌧️
