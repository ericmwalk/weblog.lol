Tried out a *new* game that has been in the closet for a while with the girl that normally doesn’t like board games. How could I pass that up. It was called [Abducktion: A Weirdly Strategic Game of Duck Kidnapping](https://www.veryspecialgames.com/products/abducktion-base-game-a-weirdly-strategic-game-of-duck-kidnapping) and let’s say it is good enough that I think we will give it another try.
