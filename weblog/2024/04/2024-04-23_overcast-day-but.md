Overcast day but the weather was good so I will take it. I didn’t really have a plan when I started but I have been trying to seek out hills more on my [runs](https://strava.com/activities/11247430751) to build up some strength in that area. Made a couple loops up and down one during the middle of the run and didn’t feel all that bad at all.
