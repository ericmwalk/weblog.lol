Backyard neighborhood [trails](https://strava.com/activities/11219273299) in my backyard neighborhood...  Would have been a good running choice until I forgot about all the rain we got earlier this week so I got to do some mudding on a couple trails. Shoes might need some hard pavement after the mid drys now.
