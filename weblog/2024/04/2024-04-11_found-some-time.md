Found some time tonight before I had to pick the youngest up from dance to squeeze this [run](https://strava.com/activities/11160965276) in. The rain stopped right before I started which gave the air that after rain smell and kept it cool out. Saw a rainbow but since I was mostly on trails there was too much tree cover to make it worth while.
