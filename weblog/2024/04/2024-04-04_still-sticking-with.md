I am baffled by what has been happening as I [posted in December](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/12/22/thanks-for-taking.html) last year when I purchsed some picturs and was handed a USB stick. I am not quite sure what is happening that some companies resorting to sending (or giving) people pictures on USB sticks! Isn't this the age of highspeed internet, almost unlimited data, and cheap online storage? I thought this was long dead but to the point, I now have in my position two USB sticks from the same orginization that we purchased pictures from from our daughters dance competiation almost a month back. The first one that we recieved 2 weeks ago was corrupt so they had to mail us another one ðŸ™„.

The best part is for people to *view* the pictures to let the company know what routines your daughters are in (by a number system) you log into SmugMug where they have all of these photos by routine. So then after they email you they load the routines on a USB stick, put them in the mail and hope for the best.

I am so confused on so many levels about what had happened.

On a positive, the pictures that they got of my daughter look really good! Also, I really canâ€™t complain about the color of the USB sticksâ€¦ ðŸ§¡
