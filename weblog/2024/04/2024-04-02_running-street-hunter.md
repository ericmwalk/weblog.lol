[Running](https://strava.com/activities/11094943143) street hunter edition... It got dark quick so I decided to use my time to pick off some streets I have not run and boy did I find elevation and some interesting places I need to circle back to at some point. Especially that trail that I didnâ€™t dare go down at the late hour it was.
