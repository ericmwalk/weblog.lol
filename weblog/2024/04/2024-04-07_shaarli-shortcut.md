# Shaarli Shortcut

I was sad to see the news inside of the Shaarli IOS app that the IOS app will cease to exist starting sometime in the summer of 2024. I am not sure if this will really happen or not but I decided to search around to find an alternative for me to quickly send a link to my Shaarli instance. I found one that Mike Rockwell at [InitialCharge](https://initialcharge.net/projects/toolkit/) had put together at some point but stated he no longer used anymore. I obviously tried to run it and it kind of worked but added a lot of extra characters in the Title and Link that I felt could be cleaned up. So I used what he started as an example to what I needed to do and started from scratch.

In the end, I put tougher a very basic example that works and I can see where I could make some improvements going forward but not sure I will do much at this time but more tried to prepare myself for the time that the IOS app might go away. The other nice thing is that this Shortcut I can use on my Mac too but obviously I can use the Bookmarklet as well so it is a little duplicative.

If you are interested feel free to copy my [Shaarli Link Share Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b4f30ff429314604a70b7518e1722c7b).
