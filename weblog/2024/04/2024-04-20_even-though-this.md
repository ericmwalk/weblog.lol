Even though this [run](https://strava.com/activities/11225861030) was longer than last week this felt so much better. I think the weather had a lot to deal with it but also being slightly more prepared. We traversed in a bunch of areas I had not gone yet and thankful I had a backup watch to my Ultra that could guide me ðŸ™ƒ.
