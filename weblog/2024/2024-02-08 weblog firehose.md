# weblog firehose?

The [now.garden](https://now.garden) feature on omg.lol has me wondering how many people are utilizing the weblog service. I ponder whether there could be a directory or a "find my feed" feature, similar to what Adam has assembled for other services (e.g., some.pics, status.lol, now.garden). While it's possible to search and find people by usernames, taking it a step further with a page organized by titles and/or an RSS feed to subscribe to would be beneficial. Now that I think about it, such a feature probably exists, and I just haven't discovered it yet.

*I was going to just include this as part of my earlier post about the [now page](https://ericmwalk.weblog.lol/2024/02/now-page) when I talked about the now.garden but then I realized it probably should be it's own thought.*
