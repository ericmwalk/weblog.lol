# Paste.lol Notes

I have not actually used [paste.lol](https://paste.lol/) all that much on but really it is a Pastebin for those of you who know what that is. I did use it already at one point to save a json to rss script file that I created with other help I found online for a specific use on my Micro.blog consumption. *More on that script another time.*

The other day, I was reminded me the other day about past.lol and as always because someone took the great omg.lol creation and then added to it by creating a web app where you can write (like I am now) and save them directly to Pastbin. The app can be found at [write.omg.lol](https://write.omg.lol).

Depending on what you want to use paste.lol for maybe it would not be that useful but for writing like I am right now, I can write in Markdown, quickly view it using the eyes in the upper right hand corner and save it to Pastbin as I go along. Obviously, in the end I am going to copy this over to my weblog.lol but you could just leave this as a single page of notes on your past bin site that I will do as well just to see how it works as well. Remember if anything you can create fun pictures in paste.lol like below:

````
{

   U  ___ u __  __    ____    _      U  ___ u  _      
    \/"_ \U|' \/ '|U /"___|u |"|      \/"_ \/ |"|     
    | | | \| |\/| |\| |  _ U | | u    | | | U | | u   
.-,_| |_| || |  | | | |_| | \| |/_.-,_| |_| |\| |/__  
 \_)-\___/ |_|  |_|  \_____  |_____\_)-\___/  |_____| 
      \\  <<,-,,-.   _)(|(") //  \\     \\    //  \\  
     (__)  (./  \.) (__)__" (_")("_)   (__)  (_")("_) 

}
````

I will have to see if this really fits into more of a process for me going forward but I do like that it is another little app that can serve a purpose in the overall omg.lol suite of applications. I wonder if I should actually call it the omg.lol toolbox or maybe the omg.lol swiss army knife of online programs. *I will keep workshopping it.*
