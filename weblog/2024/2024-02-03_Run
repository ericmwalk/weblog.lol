Kind of forced this [run](https://strava.com/activities/10689617224) by leaving myself no out. My youngest had a swim meet this morning and then other things. So I had my wife leave me at the swim meet to run home. Since I had to be home in 2 hrs to get my daughter to hockey it probably gave me more drive than needed.
