Needed to move today after a long day of being on calls and knowing my night was going to entail updating slide decks. However, on this [run](https://strava.com/activities/11011364151) if I would have been fast enough I could have snapped a picture of two beavers that quick jumped in the water and swam away here. FYI it is snowing… 🌨️🤦‍♂️
