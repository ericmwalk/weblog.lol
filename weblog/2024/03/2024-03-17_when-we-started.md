When we started the goal was 8 as we both have been a little down for the count. As we approached stopping at 12 I swayed the vote to [run](https://strava.com/activities/10981665519) another loop to get us on par with plan. Overall legs were good but my stomach not so much but we got the miles. Also ,we have been spoiled as it was cold today!
