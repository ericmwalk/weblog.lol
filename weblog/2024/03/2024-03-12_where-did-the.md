Where did the trail go? I thought they hadn’t started construction around Braemar yet and I was right and wrong as I found myself [running](https://strava.com/activities/10947189918) through chopped up trees. Let’s just say I don’t know if I was on the trail at points, had to walk over bad parts, and I got some nice cuts on my legs.
