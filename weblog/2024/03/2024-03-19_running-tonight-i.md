Running tonight I can close to a track and this came up on my watch. Very interesting and I wonder if it helps with track accuracy (which I am assuming it would). Now that I think about it this might have been around the spot I had my [GPS issue tonight](https://ericmwalk.blog/2024/03/19/between-running-into.html). ðŸ¤¨
