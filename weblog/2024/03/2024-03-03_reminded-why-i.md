# Reminded why I like app based ride services 

Say what you will about ride-sharing companies, but honestly, a coworker and I arrived at the airport at the same time and were going to share a cab. However, we were staying at different hotels 2 blocks apart.

The person coordinating the cabs said "nope you have two people and two destinations, so you need two cabs."

It was 11:30pm at night and I am sure the look of confusion crossed my face when I just said whatever we need one cab. Honestly, what the heck? That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard, as I could have just used Uber and selected two drop-off locations.

So, what did I do? Told my co-worker to jump in the cab and we would head to his hotel. The cabbies when we walked over to the cabs questioned me about the 1 and 2 locations but I just said we were going to his hotel. I can walk 2 blocks vs spending another $25 for a different cab to goto the same location.

Granted, it wasn't my money, but it was a matter of principle.
