Had fun playing this older game we would play with the kids when they were little called [The Bernstein Bears Learn to Share](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/114108/the-berenstain-bears-learn-to-share-game). We had fun and I always find it interesting what games our kids remember and still love to break out to play.
