Now that is is finally getting warmer out and the millage is creeping up I realized I am in need of a new Hydration pack since the last time I wore one the [strap broke](https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/09/18/didnt-go-as.html) and I never replaced it. So does anyone have any suggestion for a good running one?
