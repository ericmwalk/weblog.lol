Decided to hit the streets of Portland and with no [running](https://strava.com/activities/10894869068) plan. Along the way I stumbled upon this building and had to look it up later. The [Hey Building (Charles Q. Clapp Block)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Q._Clapp_Block#) which was built in 1862 by a local very prominent architect. I would love to take a glance inside as it is very narrow!
