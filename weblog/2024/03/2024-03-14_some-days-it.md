Some days it feel hard and today was that day. I decided to use the not feeling great [run](https://strava.com/activities/10959065743) to pick up some streets I hadnâ€™t completed. Nice to see the new completed building at Round Lake, should be a nice addition as the old building had no windows, no places to sit, and never used.
