Decided to do a short Easter [run](https://strava.com/activities/11077001151) today in order to hit a smaller millage goal of the week. Also, felt like with the amount of snacking and food in my future today this will be a good start. Looking at this dock I feel like it is placed out further than before but I could be wrong. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
