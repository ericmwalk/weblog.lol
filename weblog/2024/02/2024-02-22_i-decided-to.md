I decided to flex my lunch today and get this [run](https://strava.com/activities/10815894336) in since it is *short weather*! Day started crazy at work with lots of little things to tackle so I ended up working in the  dining room as I didn’t have a break long enough to make  it to my “office”. I guess I had that lunch break but priorities. 😁
