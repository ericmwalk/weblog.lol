# ChatGPT and Theme Support

I still like the work that I did late last week on the theme of this site, but I kept thinking I didn't have the colors right, as what I really wanted was something closer to the Dracula styling. Now, one could go through and change everything that I have done or snagged from others to get this looking like it is today. Or, I took the HTML template and put it in ChatGPT and asked it to update my theme in the Dracula style, and about 10 seconds later, what you are looking at now is the result. It would have most likely taken me much longer to get to the same result. I would have changed some things, checked it, and then repeated the process over and over, making sure that I got everything.

I have been finding more and more little uses for ChatGPT lately, so I have just kept it open in a tab on my computer. I was using it to help flesh out some ideas and thoughts at work, and I felt like it really helped out. So, two weeks ago, I decided to pay for a month of the Plus version to see what else the 4.0 can do for me compared to 3.5. I don't know if I have really used the Plus version to the fullest yet, but I am still just getting warmed up to more uses. I want to test out the GPTs that you can create. I created one the day I signed up for the service, but honestly, I have not spent much time with it or even using it, except for answering the questions during the setup and then maybe one or two right after that.

I hope to spend some more time overall with ChatGPT before my month is up, so I can figure out if I want to keep the paid version for longer. I think most of what I have been doing today could just be done on the free version, except for some of the images I have created, but really, those are only for fun and not a necessity.
