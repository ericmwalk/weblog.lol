# Posts with Images

In reading more chatter online, it seems like people are really checking out all of these newer indie blogging software which is great and each is on its own journey of what they doing. I think the one thing for weblog that people seem to run across as a downfall is getting images here because you really need to find another place to put them if you want more than a one-off. Through the OMG.lol suite of products, you can use [some.pics](https://some.pics) and honestly, it would probably work fine for one-off photos or if you were not planning on posting a ton of photos to the site. However, if you wanted to post say the picture from a trip or more than just one you might find it more difficult than other platforms where you can just drop them all in and away you go. I believe in this case you can upload them all but might then take a little back and forth to get the links to your post. Here is a photo that I uploaded a while back and it works fine as you can see using some.pics

*The more I think about it someone has probably created a shortcut to make this even simpler.*

With all of that said, I am going to take some guesses that more might be in store to somehow make it easier at some point in the weblog app but you have to be ok waiting for that which for me is fine because right now I am just sending the photos to my micro.blog account for the ones I have posted on this site so far. The only exception is the one above. Others I have heard use [bunny.net](https://bunny.net) or other services to have photos hosted somewhere and then just link them in here. I could see that as being a nice option as then you can probably organize and find them if you ever want to use one again. That is sometimes the downside I have found with [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) because I like to use a picture I had or if I am cleaning up things I am not sure how to easily find the picture to delete it or replace it so then it just gets lost out there not attached to any post. I am guessing this could be an issue with some of the [other services](/2024/02/it-works-but-how-does-this-work-again) I mentioned the other day and might be the same for some.pics but I shouldn't say that too fast as I know it wants to have you put a description so maybe you can find it that way.
