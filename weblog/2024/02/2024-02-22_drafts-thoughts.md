I think the idea of drafts still is very compelling but there is a part of me thinking there is just to much it can do and I really just am overwhelmed by all the buttons and sidebars. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I kind of wish it had either a first time setup or almost hide anything/everything more than the text editor basic stuff. I get the power is everything else but since I know I might only use one or two things right away it is just very cluttered and I feel like I want more of a blank environment when I am typing on my phone (now) or earlier on my Mac.

I am going to give this a go for a little bit longer to see if it fits in my workflow of life.
