I have spent way more time than I would like to admit messing around with weblog.lol today. However, I am pleased with the overall result as I have a *working* website with an updated theme that I am happy with in the direction it is taking. I jokingly say *working* because for the life of me, the box below I cannot get to format right, no matter what I do. However, if you look at it now, it probably looks good enough that no one will be the wiser on how much effort I spent tinkering with it.

Reflecting back, I realized that since I haven't really touched this site since a year ago, I had some very old configurations and knowledge of what was going on (not that I really had the right knowledge to begin with). So, some of my time today was spent watching a very helpful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdr1uDiwcO4) Adam (the creator of weblog.lol and omg.lol) put together earlier last year, as well as diving into some webpage source codes. Only to then find out some very nice people have their weblog.lol sites like mine on GitHub with it open to view the configuration files. I'm not sure if those people meant to have them as public projects on GitHub, so I will not link directly to them, but I do appreciate that they did, as I could get some ideas of how things were done by doing that. I am not really sure if I will end up closing mine off and making it private, as I am not sure if there is anything here that should be closed off. However, if I do, I will make sure to link to a copy of my template and configuration files, as those are the things really helpful if you are a noob like me when it comes to weblog and honestly CSS.

If you are wondering what is next with this site, it is still **to be determined**, but I have enjoyed my time diving into it and flexing my brain in a way I normally don't on a day-to-day basis. Maybe I will try to post something on here every day for February and see how that goes.
