# Now Page

It probably took me too long, but I finally managed to put together a "[now](https://ericmwalk.omg.lol/now)" page on omg.lol. At this point, it's pretty basic, and I might work on it a bit more here and there. One thing I'm interested in, because I've known about this "now" page concept in the past, is whether I will update it after today. I could see myself doing this work now and then forgetting I had a page like that, never returning to it a week or two later. However, there's a setting in your "now" page that can nudge you every so many days. I picked 7 to keep it consistent, so we'll see if that spurs me to update it next week.

Another interesting feature specific to omg.lol users is the "[now garden](https://now.garden)." Everyone on omg.lol who has a "now" page and checks the box to make it visible in the garden shows up there. It's sorted by the most recent update, which is nice because then you can click around if you're curious to see how other people have created theirs or if you're wondering what people are up to... NOW.

*If you are wondering what a Now Page is and got to the end check out this [omg.lol now page reference](https://home.omg.lol/info/now) that also links to the origination of a now page for even **more** information.*
