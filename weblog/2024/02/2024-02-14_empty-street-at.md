The plan was to wake up earlier than normal to [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/10759794652) but I got a little bit more of a head start today since for some unknown reason my daughters set an alarm for 4:30am. I guess overall I can't complain as I was able to take a slightly different route to get some more elevation.
