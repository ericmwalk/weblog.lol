Decided to [run](https://strava.com/activities/11578614134) along the York River which want to bad as I found some interesting scenery as well as the Wiggly Bridge. However, once I got into more wooded trails I was wondering why I didn‚Äôt run along the ocean again as these wooded trails are like what I can find in Minnesota. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
