Donâ€™t get me wrong I actually accomplished a lot of work in my 12+ hrs I was in the Portland Airport. However, I did try to have some fun with it as I was reminded of the old movie [The Terminal](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/594) with Tom Hanks and what else are you going to do but create some fun images with ChatGPT.
