Started early today as my running friend I could tell wanted me to help push him the extra distance and I had a hard stop at 11 AM. Granted he created a route that gave us some outs but I knew my role and even though longer than I had [run](https://strava.com/activities/11549156251) this year he has a race coming up so we got the miles done.
