I guess the sign was actually correct today by saying the Trail was underwater. By the time I [ran](https://strava.com/activities/11753788700) across the sign and then into this bypass I was of at a path of no return in having to backtrack quite a bit. Normally I would power though and just get my feet soaked but i decided against it today.
