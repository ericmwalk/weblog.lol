Decided to do a little morning Fatherâ€™s Day [run ](https://www.strava.com/activities/11668397782)solo that I regretted due to the heat and humidity. The wind was nice but only seemed to feel it when I was head on. Slightly thankful I am not training for anything so nothing mattered or was required of me. Except getting back to our camper. ðŸ¥µ
