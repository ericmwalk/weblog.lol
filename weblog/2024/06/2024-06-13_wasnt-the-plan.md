Wasn’t the plan to [run](https://www.strava.com/activities/11646984919) this sort of a distance as I was thinking something shorter  at the hottest time of the day. However, since I was waiting for my son and his friend to finish golfing I had time on my son and honestly I need this time, space, and miles after the last couple of weeks.
