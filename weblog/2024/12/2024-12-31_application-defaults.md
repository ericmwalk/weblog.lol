# 2024 Application Defaults

# 2024 Application Defaults

It is about time as it seems like everyone else is doing a 2024 update to the *Dual of the Defaults* so I figured I would get it in right under the wire. Again a big shout out to [Hemispheric Views and their Episode 097](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) when this idea was hatched and to [Robb](https://rknight.me/app-defaults/) who is still keeping track of all of this.

So onto the 2024 list and lets see what has changed ([2023 List](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/11/06/application-defaults.html))...
- ✉️ **Mail Client**: Apple Mail
- 📨 **Mail Server**: GoogleSuite & Apple Mail
- 📝 **Notes**: Apple Notes (plus Obsidian plus GoodNotes for Work) - *Change*
- ✅ **To-Do**: Reminders
- 📷 **iPhone Photo Shooting**: Camera.app
- 📚 **Photo Management**: Photos.app
- 🗓️ **Calendar**: Calendar.app
- 🗄️ **Cloud file storage**: iCloud and Google Drive (still a mess but getting better)
- 📰 **RSS**: Reeder with FreshRSS
- 📇 **Contacts**: Contacts.app (Google Backend)
- 🕸️ **Browser**: Safari (plus Chrome for Work)
- 💬 **Chat**: iMessage and Discord
- 🔖 **Bookmarks**: LinkAce - *Change (also I blame Robb for this)*
- 👓 **Read It Later**:  *Not using anything at the moment*
- 📜 **Word Processing**: Google Docs
- 📊 **Spreadsheets**: Google Sheets (plus Excel for Work)
- 🛝 **Presentations**: Google Slides
- 🛒 **Shopping Lists**: Alexa Lists 😱
- 🧑‍🍳 **Meal Planning**: *None* - Based on what I buy we cook 🤷‍♂️
- 💰 **Budgeting & Personal Finance**: Copilot - *Change*
- 🗞️ **News**: Apple News and various sources in RSS
- 🎶 **Music**: Apple Music
- 🎧 **Podcasts**: PocketCasts
- 🔐**Password Management:** iCloud KeyChain *(Not a change but found my old KeePass file as it had some things on it I needed for my kids over break. So it is kind of in use right now as I need to migrate that in 2025 to something better.)*

So overall I have had 3 changes of which my note taking apps I feel like change all of the time so that is really hard to count. So in other things I think the most sinificant is the other two as my wife and I have settled in on Copilot and have enjoyed using it for basic finance tracking. Also, even though I kind of did it on a whim and figured I would go back to Shaarli I have been enjoying using LinkAce for bookmarking. I think my only issue is every time it says there is an upgrade I forget how to do it. However, now that I think about it, it was the same for Shaarli too.
