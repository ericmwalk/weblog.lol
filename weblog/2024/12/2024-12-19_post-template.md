# Obsidian Post Template

Go figure my first time ever making a Template in Obsidian is when I decided to go a little further in this Obsidian Publish and figured out a way to "automate" some features as well as help keep things organized. So this is what I have come up with so far.

	---
	permalink: {{date:YYYY}}/{{date:MM}}/{{date:DD}}/post-title
	tags: 
	date: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
	publish: "false"
	---
	

*The permalink feature is really nice as this also helped solve a problem I had where I had to keep everything in the Vault root. Now as long as you are going to use Permalinks you can kind of put it anywhere.*
