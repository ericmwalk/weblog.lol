# Spending time with Weblog

I have spent way more time than I would like to admit messing around with weblog.lol today. However, I am pleased with the overall result as I have a *working* website with a updated theme. I jokingly say working because for the life of me the box below this I can not get to format right not matter what I do. However, if you look at it now it probably looks good enough that no one will be the wiser on how much effort I spent tinkinger with it.

Reflecting back I realized that seeing how I haven't really touched this site since a year ago I had some very old configuration and knowledge of what was going on (not that I really had the right knowledge to begin with). So some of my time today was spent watching a very helpful video Adam put together earlier last year as well as diving into some webpage source codes only to then find out some very nice people have their weblog.lol sites like mine on github with it open to view the configuration files. This is actually a wonderful thing and I don't see a reason why I am going to close mine off at this point but if I end up making it a private project I will make sure to make public the configuration files and templates as those are really helpful for anyone who wants to tinker with it more than what is default.
