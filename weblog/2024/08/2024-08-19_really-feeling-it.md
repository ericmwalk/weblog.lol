To continue with the shocked day my daughter wanted to ride back home after riding all the way out to my parents house this morning. We stayed there for some swimming and then had lunch. Even after that she still wanted to [ride](https://strava.com/activities/12190761974) back home so we did. Honestly, I am super proud of her for wanting to do it and I really enjoyed our time together.
