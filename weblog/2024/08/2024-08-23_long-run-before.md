Long [run](https://strava.com/activities/12221680215) before the weekend. Probably should have bailed before I started.. Didn’t get great sleep, iPods only half worked, and after the first mile it down poured for 10 min. Then stopped until about the last 10 min just to make sure I was soaked the whole way.
