This was a fun unplanned exploring [run](https://strava.com/activities/12141382453) today. We ended up on a road I had been meaning to find in Eden Prairie that is now closed for years and also we were around the Ghost town of Hennepin Village.

*Guess I am glad we ran from the bottoms up to this sign as I can say I didnâ€™t know.*
