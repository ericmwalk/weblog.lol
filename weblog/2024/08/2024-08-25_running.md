Despite the stifling weather I had to go out and test the [new shoes](https://ericmwalk.blog/2024/08/25/new-running-shoe.html) on a short [run](https://strava.com/activities/12242787483). There is a road closed in the neighborhood that I can never really run on so took advantage of that to see what was on the other side of the street.
