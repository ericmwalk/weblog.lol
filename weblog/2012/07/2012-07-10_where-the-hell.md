Thanks to Andrew Hyde's post (<a href="http://andrewhy.de/where-the-hell-is-matt-2012/">Where The Hell is Matt 2012</a>) I have ran across the website called "<a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/" target="_blank">Where the Hell is Matt?</a>" and more importantly the video below.

This is an awesome video but you can also check out some of the prior years on his website.  Good Luck going forward Matt Harding (<a title="@WhereTheHIsMatt" href="https://twitter.com/wherethehismatt" target="_blank">@WhereTheHIsMatt</a>) and can't wait to see the 2013 video.
