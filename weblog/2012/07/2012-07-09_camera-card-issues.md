A couple weeks ago we went to the zoo and took our Cannon Digital XLR camera along as we always do in order to capture pictures of our kids.  However, after a full morning of taking pictures we got home and were going to load them on the Mac when we got a lovely message that the camera card needed to be reformatted and no pictures were found...

WHAT!?

I was sure that was a mistake, so we plugged it into a few other machines but each one said the same thing. For my family we love to take pictures and have been doing it for a long time.  About 8 years ago we went to Peru for vacation and took 100+ pictures a day for each of the 14 days we were there.  So after realizing that the Card was "Really" not working right I started looking for any type of software that could help recover our pictures from the day.

Let's just say if you want to check and see if you have a chance of recovering anything you can easily do a quick Google search and find a lot of trial software.  I ended up installing a few of them from companies that I felt I could trust.  The nice thing about most of the trial software is that you could run the SD Card recovery and get a preview of the photos it found before you had to purchase the full version.  In the end we bought the eSupport.com product called <a href="http://undeleteplus.com/?ref=854">Undelete Plus</a> and were able to get all of the photos back from that day.  In reality this seemed like a lot of the other products but I liked that this one can restore more than just pictures and videos like the other two I was reviewing.

<em><strong>Update:</strong> </em>After this issue happened we decided to use our old CF Camera card we purchased at the same time as our camera.  Also, we just got back from a 2 week vacation of taking pictures with no issues.  I think in looking back the issue relied in the CF Card Adapter as we had previously tried to replace the SD card.
