I stumbled upon Kirby Ferguson because of the TED Talk video that was posted a few days ago.  I would encourage you to watch the video as it really starts to make you think about copyright laws.  One of my favorite quotes is "Everything is a Remix, until you are the one getting remixed."

After doing a little more research on <span style="color:#0000ee;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kirby</span></span><a href="https://twitter.com/remixeverything" target="_blank"> Ferguson</a>, I ended up watching a couple more videos titled Everything is a Remix, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1s_PybOuY0" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-HuenDPZw0" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq5D43qAsVg" target="_blank">Part 3</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmmtCJxJJY" target="_blank">Part 4</a> from his site <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/" target="_blank">Everything is a Remix</a>.  I am still shocked that the opening to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven" target="_blank">Stairway to Heaven</a> by Led Zeppelin was copied from Spirits song titled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(song)" target="_blank">Taurus</a>.  I guess it goes to emphasize one of Kerby's quotes that says "Creativity isn't Magic, it happens by applying ordinary tools of thoughts to existing materials".  Also, another one of the quotes that is pointed to a specific company is "When we copy we justify it, when others copy we vilify it."  In addition to the videos described above he recently had a Kickstarter video project funded earlier this year titled "<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kirby/this-is-not-a-conspiracy-theory">This is Not a Conspiracy Theory</a>".  Even though the KickStarter project is closed and fully funded, I would encourage you to donate to his work from his website if you think the videos <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info/donate/" target="_blank">Every Thing Is A Remix</a>, were as interesting as I did.

As I too have not created anything new by this post, I would like to again re-quote something from the videos, "I invented nothing new.  I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.  Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have failed."

Keep up the good work Kirby and I look forward to seeing more of your work.
