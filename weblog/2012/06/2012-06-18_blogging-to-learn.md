# Blogging to Learn

A while back I had read a blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cdixon">Chris Dixon</a> on <a href="http://cdixon.org/2012/05/10/blogging-to-learn/">Blogging to Learn</a>, it was a short post but the last point he made really made me think.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Try to learn at least one interesting thing each week and then blog about it. Then see how people react in comments, on Twitter etc. I guess some bloggers don’t like comments but for me they are the crucial so that I can get feedback on new hypotheses. Blogging new hypotheses also means a decent portion of your blog posts need to be ignored or ridiculed. Otherwise you are playing it too safe.</em></p>
<em></em>The one sentence that really stuck out for me was the first.  So instead of making excuses that I don't have anything to write about or that I don't have time to write, I should find one interesting thing ever week to write about.  I am guessing some weeks it will be more interesting than others but if anything that will help get the habit formed.  Just as if you were going to run a marathon, it all starts with the consistency of running before you can really start building up the miles.
