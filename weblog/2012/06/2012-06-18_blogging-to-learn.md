# Blogging to Learn

A while back I had read a blog post by [Chris Dixon](https://twitter.com/#!/cdixon) on [Blogging to Learn](http://cdixon.org/2012/05/10/blogging-to-learn/), it was a short post but the last point he made really made me think.

>Try to learn at least one interesting thing each week and then blog about it. Then see how people react in comments, on Twitter etc. I guess some bloggers don’t like comments but for me they are the crucial so that I can get feedback on new hypotheses. Blogging new hypotheses also means a decent portion of your blog posts need to be ignored or ridiculed. Otherwise you are playing it too safe.

The one sentence that really stuck out for me was the first.  So instead of making excuses that I don't have anything to write about or that I don't have time to write, I should find one interesting thing ever week to write about.  I am guessing some weeks it will be more interesting than others but if anything that will help get the habit formed.  Just as if you were going to run a marathon, it all starts with the consistency of running before you can really start building up the miles.
