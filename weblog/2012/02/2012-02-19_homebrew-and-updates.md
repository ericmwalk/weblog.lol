So it has been over a month since my last post but for good reason. My daughter (second child) was born not long after that so that has been keeping me a little more occupied that normal.

With this wonderful delay in my life, it additionally allowed me to give my homebrew some additional time to sit.  Now that I had a few moments to spare I finally decided to give it a taste.  I might be bias but I think it turned out pretty good for my first time back at it.  In fact, I was able to taste the hint of Maple Syrup in the beer.

I have been wanting to brew another batch of a different kind but I haven't found the time to do that yet.

However, just because I haven't found the time to do any other homebrews don't think everything has been put on the back burner.  I have still been working my project but it is still not quite where I would like it to be.  I have finished a house project of redoing the master bathroom as well as painting our master bedroom (I will put more pictures and time in an upcoming post to show the long process).   Then to top it off, things have been really busy at work lately as well as another person in our department has decided to leave.  However, I can't fault her since she is not moving for a better job in town, she is moving to be with her boyfriend out in California because he got a job out there.

Well time to get ready for another work week.
