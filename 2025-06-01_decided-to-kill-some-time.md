Decided to kill some time and [ran](https://www.strava.com/activities/14667571846) some loops around these ponds in Maple Grove while waiting for my daughter at a birthday party. I havenâ€™t spent much time up here but it is a really nice area with lots of walking, running, biking trails around this main area. Not sure you can tell from the photo but the sky is filled with smoke so I guess it helped keep me out of the sun.
